'Organic' agriculture goes along with that theme, but certified organic is an over-reaction.
If you are trying to produce 90 billion eggs a year (the current USA poultry production) you cannot have 8 backyard chickens with 10 acres to roam unless you spread all those chickens out among a lot of different farmers, and that costs more money then you are willing to pay at the market for a dozen eggs (mine dollar 3 a dozen for free range, organic eggs) that is about dollar 1 more per dozen then super market eggs.
In 2010 9 billion chickens were slaughtered for food.
do not try to raise food to feed 1,000 people, raise enough food to feed 100 and let 9 other farmers do the same.
But, you consumer, need to be willing to use more of your income to feed yourself and your family healthy food.
Organic farming is the only solution to get rid of these poisonous foods loaded with pesticides.
Almost all the food products nowadays are with high levels of pesticide residues.
So organic farming is the best alternative in order to sustain the agriculture for future generations.
Though the argument is valid,scientists proved that continuous organic farming over year,may pickup the yields on par with inorganic farming.
In the US, regulation and safety of GMO foodstuffs is regulated by the FDA, in combination with the USDA and EPA.
The FDA was formed to fight dangerous food, drugs, and cosmetics, and is not beholden to agricultural business .
I do not say anyone should eat GMO foods, I say no one should avoid them.
If they are as good for you, and less expensive than organic, non-GMO food (and a lot of studies have shown that organic is no heal their than conventional (GMO or not)), then there is no reason to not eat GMO foods.
Organic certification is pretty much worthless.
it is probably the case that industrial organic is slightly better for the environment than industrial conventional, but any process that uses fewer machines and works better with the soil is going to be superior to either.
The regulatory label "organic" is pretty much worthless at that scale.
I think people think that organic meat is automatically humanely raised meat.
Improve their knowlege of farming and food production methods.
Organic food is grown without artificial chemicals and buying it is beneficial for two main reasons.
The second reason is that you are voting organic.
Buying organic means you are not supporting companies who think it is okay to poison the earth (us humans included).
Buying good food should be seen as a priority not a luxury... it is an apple not a thousand dollar handbag.
I believe that organic farming methods are, without question, better for the environment, the soil, and the people (often poor) who harvest the crops.
People generally do not buy Organic Food because of two reasons: High Cost Trust for the Organic Brand for which high price is paid.
Let me tell you first why Organic Food is expensive?
Organic food supply is limited as compared to demand; Production costs for organic foods are typically higher because of greater labour inputs per unit of output Post-harvest handling of relatively small quantities of organic foods results in higher costs because of the mandatory segregation of organic and conventional produce, especially for processing and transportation; Marketing and the distribution chain for organic products is relatively inefficient and costs are higher because of relatively small volumes.
In order to trust the Organic Brand you should check the norms (international and national)- like NPOP, USDA, etc - which have set the standards and which conform to these guidelines and certify producers.
The company which you can trust for Organic produce is 24 Mantra.
Organic farmers can legally use pesticides and many do.
And it is not always a question of organic pesticides - most are.
Everything on the planet is organic - even man made things are compiled from organic elements.
The meat and seafood is good at Whole Foods as well.
Companies selling the largest volume of organics are Wal-Mart, Costco, Kroger, Target, Safeway, and Whole Foods.
Companies are in business to make money, not dispense goodness, so by their own standard, the best is Whole Foods with 36% overall gross profit percent versus 28% for others.
I dislike Whole Foods because it fosters the idea that healthy food costs too much.
While, as already metioned, that eating organic products usually prevent or at least deminish your intake of pesticides, hormones, antibiotics etc.
Another good reason for eating organic foods is for ethical reasons.
Many vegitarians and vegans could probably list many books and websites that explain and show all the horrific things that take place in these factories(these places are not farms) that mass produce beef, pork, chicken etc., but I am neither and will just compare it will organic animal husbandry practices.
In conventional egg production the chicken lives it is entire life in a tiny cage(typically 2-4 in each cage), often for two years enforce they are slaughtered for chick stock or dog food.
The same goes on where the animals live in tiny cages and gets fed the cheapest possible food out there.
Organic farming on the other hand, treats it is animals and treats nature with more consideration.
Here's the tip offs: Conventional celery is much larger and paler than organically grown.
Organic celery is a nice deep (almost electric) Green because it is gotten lots of sun which stimulates chlorophyll growth, and thus the flavor you and I like.
I can use 3 stalks of our organic to flavor s big pot of soup, while with conventional I must use double (or more).
Also, the opposite of "organic" in the context it is typically used is "conventional", not "GMO".
As to your question, no, there are not significant difference in the environmental impacts of typical organic foods versus most conventional foods, or most GM foods.
They are all often both equally destructive of soil, and all can equally end up with excess amounts of harmful chemicals accumulating in the environment (whether "organic" or not).
The one significant difference I can think of, which on a wide enough scale could be rather dramatic, is the use of synthetic nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers in the production of conventional food.
With organic production, it is possible a similar effect could occur, though differing practices might limit the severity as well.
I buy (mostly) organic because I want to (1) increase animal welfare (there are stricter regulations for the treatment of the animals in the Danish equivalent of "organic") and (2) to avoid spreading pesticides, certain types of fertilizers, overuse of antibiotics, etc.
The advertising and reasons I could gather that most people bought organic was because they thought it was better for them.
A relatively recent meta study (a study aggregating the results of several different studies) found no benefit: Little evidence of health benefits from organic foods, Stanford study finds .
Organic food is largely a marketing scam.
While there may be individual examples of organic farms using the very best practices where the output per acre is higher, if you look at the category of foods labeled USDA organic overall they are an average of 25% less productive based off of a meta analysis of many many different studies ( <url> " I have nothing against the best practices, but honestly those need not be restricted to Organic.
Indeed one leading plant genetic engineer strongly believes we should combine the best of both organic/traditional farming and genetic modification to meet the worlds food demands and lower our environmental impact ( <url> " ).
Additionally, a very large meta study conducted at Stanford found no health benefits to organic food.
Likewise, places like Whole foods benifit greatly by misleading consumers into thinking their produce is somehow safer and better for the environment and thus can charge MUCH higher prices for foods that are basically identical.
I basically see organic labels and non-GMO labels as a way to do this.
But local and organic food are not synonymous.
Likewise I can get food labelled organic that is flown in from across the world.
Overall on the the biggest problems I have with the 'Organic' label though is that it is misleading.
I bet you there are some organic farms that are superior to conventional but I would argue they are the minority.
I have no issue with environmentally friendlier agricultural practices, I just argue that the USDA organic label really does not represent those.
The foods are proven no more safe and overall are likely worse for the environment.
I truly believe that the majority of "organic" produce sold in super markets is all about marketing and is misleading to the consumers.
I just want you to know I am not attacking your point on better farming practices, but just specifically the idea that organic food you buy at the super market is better than conventional.
But again, this is not about organic but rather about heirloom foods (organic does not mean heirloom varieties).
First of all, "Organic" is a widely used term that is often loosely applied to signify "clean", "natural" or "free of synthesized ingredients".
Organic food is, more clearly, food grown without synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers.
would mean "Certified Organic" under some public authority.. To be certified it would be cultivated under certain rules and perhap from an inspected farm.
Organic food is actively planted and managed using methods adapted to the plant and the local environment.
So, while wild berries that you pick might happen to be organic (or they might not, if they come from a ditch along a conventional sprayed farm!
And Certified Organic is farmed, planted, not wild.
That would be local, home grown, but not organic.
And then there are families or companies whose property is legally Certified Organic and they can sell a certified organic Main Wild Blueberry that you could also say was "Wildcrafted"
Cows do not know they are organic and nowhere in organic standards set by the NOP are there any rules on what species and varieties of crops can be fed as long as they are not GMO and grown under organic practices.
What I am saying is that it really does not matter what scale of organic farming we are talking cows are likely to be eating at least some corn.
Its considerably more profitable to grow than many other crops even if under organic management you can only grow it in the rotation every 2-4 years on a field at best.
Organic foods refer to food items that are grown without the use of chemicals, fertilizers or any unnatural interference.
Organic foods refer to all food products that are allowed to grow in their natural surroundings without any human interference or genetic modifications.
I assume so, because the food tastes better there, it is marked as organic, and emphasis is put on high quality products from responsible farmers.
(or, at least, they have been very good at reinforcing this belief in me via their in-store marketing efforts) what is more, I also perceive that purchasing products from a big company like Whole Foods is potentially less risky from a health standpoint than going to a local farmer's market...

"Natural" or "organic" pesticides (organic growers all use pesticides, they just use organic ones) can be just as safe/harmless as synthetic ones.
Second, if a pesticide left residue on your food that could harm you, it would not be sold, else the farmer applied it wrong.
Whether the pesticide was organic or not would not matter.
Third, if the organic chemical is weaker, it will be applied in a higher dose and more frequently.
Last, several cases exist where organic pesticides are worse than synthetics.
The organic equivalent, that also leaves no residues and is equally effective as an herbicide, is Pharm Solutions Weed Pharm, made of 20% acetic acid (concentrated vinegar).
For the farmer, it means they must use goggles and protective clothing when using the organic herbicide, but can use roundup naked if they so choose.
Evidence shows that people who eat organic food have no health benefits compared to conventional agriculture food: they are neither heal their nor less sick, but do spend more.
If you are a grower, look at the labels on the pesticide and decide for yourself if it is toxic or not, but pay no heed to buzzwords like "natural," "organic," or "synthetic" that have no bearing on safety of efficacy, period.
I eat an almost 100% organic food diet and I am reasonably certain that I have benefited from it but I still cannot give an unqualified yes to this question.
There are several problems with organic standards and certification.
Organic food used to be produced by small-scale farmers who grew incredibly high quality produce without using any toxic chemicals.
In the last 15 years that has changed and organics is now largely out of control of farmers and firmly in the hands of the certi for your information ng bodies (such as the USDA in america) and the huge companies that have largely taken over the organic food market.
Here is a bit of a catch up on the current state of the union when it comes to organic food.
In many cases organic certification represents a minimum standard that farmers (and big-agriculture companies) use as a checklist in order to put an official stamp on their product and then command a higher price for food that is not much different to conventional produce.
One example from about 15 years ago in the USA was Horizon Dairy which had previously been a conventional dairy using hormones, antibiotics, and feeding their cows non-organic feed.
The USDA published their guidelines for organic certification in 2000 and Horizon (along with many other huge food operations) saw massive profits to be made and switched their cows to organic feed, stopped giving them hormones and hey presto they were now organic certified.
* Their cows had the absolute minimum access to pasture and were just being shoveled massive piles of organic corn feed rather than conventional corn feed.
They were now on an even playing field on store shelves with more legitimate companies like Organic Valley which was a co-operative of smaller farms that were operated much more like what we all imagine an organic dairy farm to look like.
If you live in the USA you can walk in to a Sam's Club or a Wal-Mart and see huge tubs of store-brand, organic produce that is often farmed in China on massive farms that spray organic fertilizers, use organic certified pesticides, and pay low wages that would be illegal in the USA.
The distinction between some of the organic and conventional foods on these store-shelves is going to be superficial at best.
Organic Standards are massively different in different countries.
Behind the scenes there is constant jockeying by pesticide and fertilizer companies to get their products listed as certified organic.
Multibillion-dollar companies are now heavily invested in organic foods.
These include Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Whole Foods, and The Coca-Cola Company amongst many others.
As a result of being stakeholders in organic standards they lobby the certi for your information ng bodies whenever organic standards come under periodic review.
In many cases these companies have campaigned to weaken organic standards and allow conventional farming practices to creep into their operations and still get the all-important organic label.
It is not that these companies are evil it is just that organic farming is inherently more costly than conventional farming.
Their economic incentives are to try to reduce the costs of organic farming while still commanding the higher price that an organic label will get them.
The Good News It is possible to eat food that is organic in the old sense of the word, grown by farmers who have integrity and seek to grow food without spraying them with horrible poisons.
** You have to do your research though and look at organic certification as the baseline minimum standard rather than the final word on food safety.
As Evita Ochel points out there is solid research showing benefits from eating organic foods despite all these compromises that have been made to organic standards.
Ask them if they actually grow the food they are selling or if they are a reseller.
Ask them if they grow organically.
If you shop at big retailers like Whole Foods or a regular supermarket selling organic food look at the labels carefully.
Google the brands of food you are buying and find out if there are controversies involved in their ingredients.
Check out Food Babe who for all the controversy surrounding her is one of the most effective campaigners to hold companies' feet to the fire in terms of food safety.
You may or may not agree with everything she says but her guides are a good start to educating yourself about food ingredients.
Footnotes: * Horizon has since then cleaned up their act significantly and USDA organic standards have gotten tougher on feedlot operations that try to get organic certified.
Avoiding this one chemical is reason enough to eat organic.
it is illegal to say its organic if it is not .
there is a lot of organic stuff round now, and supermarkets will clearly label those items.
Look for the word organic.
If you are staying for a while or emigrating here, consider using an organic box scheme.
This is a cheaper way of buying organic.
If you are holidaying, look for either the COOP or Waitrose supermarkets for the largest organic and fair trade variety.
Fair trade is partly organic too by the way, as it bans certain nasty pesticides etc, just not as many, and also has high animal welfare standards.
Ps you can google for organic pubs and restaurants too!
For this reason, consumers accept that a product is "organic", "natural" and so forth because a label says so, without regard for what those terms mean in the legal context, in the context of the FDA and USDA, or what *other* ingredients are in the box.
In other words, people are not yet eating food the way Earth delivers it to us.
So long as our primary source of food is boxes, bags and cans, we are unlikely to see any significant improvement in the health of the general population.
In addition to the wonderful points in the answer made by Michele Trainer , there has been increasing research over the past few years especially shedding light on the importance of eating organic.
Here is one example that examined many studies: Page on ncl.ac.uk "We carried out meta-analyses based on 343 peer-reviewed publications that indicate statistically significant and meaningful differences in composition between organic and non-organic crops/crop-based foods" Other research and a simple example is available in the book "Toxin Toxout" by Lourie and Smith, whose simple experiment demonstrated how much pesticide levels fell in children's bodies when eating solely organic, and how much they rose again when given conventional food.
Unfortunately such tests do not exist, as our body, our food, and life is too dynamic.
When in doubt about organics, we simply need to ask ourselves: does it feel/seem right to eat food that has been naturally grown or chemically grown?
In fact organics have inspired me to grow some of my own food, as the differences in flavor alone are huge and so worth it!
And if someone eats animal products, not just plants, then there is even more at stake given how animals are raised today on drugs, and GMO and pesticide-based foods.
And when we start thinking a little more globally, and consider the effects of eating organic on more than just ourselves, then we find that many more reasons to go organic.
One thing though, in the hopes of justi for your information ng their price, 'organic' farms try to harvest their products later than conventional farms, meaning the fruit can be tastier than an early harvest.
The harvest conditions are possible as 'organic' farms are usually much smaller in scale, allowing the farmer to harvest just so and shipped off.
However if you go to farmers market, you will be able to get tree ripened non organic fruits that tastes awesome.
"Organic food" IS the normal condition!
"Organic" is of course a marketing term, as mentioned by Craig.
What I am talking about is actual organic grown vegetables grown on an actual field you can walk over in under an hour and without getting all sorts of cancer.
Craig, I have been eating organic vegan food for decades.
If GMO food is so great, why are Monsanto and the Grocery Manufacturers of America spending zillions to keep it unlabeled?
Organic is a concept, hijacked to increase prices and gain marketing advantage.
When the caveman only had organic food he lived a shorter life - Perhaps some chemicals and GMO's make us live longer?
Organic food is far more likely to be higher quality in nutrition and taste.
Also organic food is far more likely to be sustainable to the environment.
Is Organic More Nutritious?
Organic certification does not guarantee any of these things.
Ironic because when there are exceptions, almost always it is due to THEIR lobbying efforts of the certification boards to make loopholes to allow THEIR inferior products to be certified organic.
Doubly ironic because the original purpose of the certification boards was to prevent industrial growers from fraudulently labeling food as organic that really was not grown organically.
Many organic, local, high quality, healthy options.
Save mart, key foods market, piggly wiggly, local organic stores!
Same is happening in organic stores Organic stores in India do not source their items locally.
If you are in AP, they source it from Kerala, Uttarakhand etc Objective is to confuse consumer with fantastic organic labels.
None of the natural farmers around the city supply to these organic stores because price offered is less than 30% of consumer price.
This is the reason for not increasing of natural farmers number even though demand of organic food increasing at high rate Unless you know the source of food, its difficult to say based on our five senses as modern technology invented some chemical to trick these five senses.
If the question is whether we can 'trust' food that we buy in the grocery store to be safe in the western world, the answer actually is that food has never been safer.
Yet while we fret about pesticides on apples, mercury in tuna, and mad cow disease, we should remember that ingesting food is, and always has been, inherently dangerous.
Page on jacobinmag.com What comes to being duped by conventional food - we are not 'duped' what comes to health benefits of food, although this is a popular narrative told by many, often people who want to sell you some kind of an alternative product.
'Organic' in food context is a marketing label construct that creates a commercial advantage in sales compared to what is called conventionally farmed food (99 % of farming in the US).
Organic food certainly does not solve any health risks of food, although their marketing may imply otherwise, and that you could call being duped.
Several comprehensive reviews support the view that there are no nutritional or health benefits from organic products.
I lay them out in this piece: Organic vs conventional food The summary: It must be reasonable to assume, that should there be a stable measurable difference in the nutritional content of organic food, other reviews would be able to arrive at that conclusion independently of each other.
Instead, we have four reviews on similar lines - finding no nutritional or health benefits of organic food.
When you talk about fruits and vegetables, most of the genetic enhancement and modification is done to improve taste and in this case organic foods do not taste better.
They are also artificially ripened and due to cross breeding, can grow up to ten times as big as their organic alternatives.
However, there is something a bit generic and bland about enhanced fruits and vegetables and something inherently original about their organic variants.
Unlike fruits and vegetables, organic meats do taste a lot better than the steroid enhanced alternatives as it is difficult to alter the taste f an animal.
Organic fruits and vegetables are a lot heal their and have gained a lot of popularity in recent times.
These chemicals are widely used in conventional agriculture and residues remain on (and in) the food we eat.
Organic food is often fresher .
Fresh food tastes better.
Organic food is usually fresher because it does not contain preservatives that make it last longer.
Organic produce is often (but not always, so watch where it is from) produced on smaller farms near where it is sold.
Organic farming is better for the environment.
Organic farming practices reduce pollution (air, water, soil), conserve water, reduce soil erosion, increase soil fertility, and use less energy.
Organically raised animals are NOT given antibiotics, growth hormones, or fed animal byproducts .
Organic food is GMO-free .
Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) or genetically engineered (GE) foods are plants or animals whose DNA has been altered in ways that cannot occur in nature or in traditional crossbreeding, most commonly in order to be resistant to pesticides or produce an insecticide.
In most countries, organic crops contain no GMOs and organic meat comes from animals raised on organic, GMO-free feed.
The European Union funded study found that organic fruit and vegetables have up to 50% more antioxidants, which scientists believe can cut the risk of cancer and heart disease.
The taste of organic fruits and vegetables is often superior to any conventional produce.
that is why many top restaurants use organic produce in their menu.
However, the taste of fresh organic fruits is irresistible!
The advantages of organic foods might be highest for babies.
By feeding your child organic food, it will have about 1/6th the amount of carcinogens in its blood.
Therefore, especially for infants and children a raw organic food diet is incredibly important.
All organic produce are nutritionally equal in terms of vitamin profiles.
As in, organic produce is at a higher baseline toxicity (seeds are bred that way).
Yes, this is the same in the other plants, but organics start out at that higher level, skyrocketing final readings.
That means that organics are on the magnitude of 1,000 to 1,000,000 times more toxic.
EVen with natural pesticides, organics are not fully protected and spend a lot of their valuable time making more self-defense toxins.
The variations between organic and traditional foods stem directly from the farming ways that were used throughout the food's production.
Below may be a list of a number of the key variations between organic and traditional farming.
Organic farming works to extend property, variety, and to encourage sensible soil and air quality.
Organic Farming Organic farming minimizes chemical usage Organic farming promotes variety Soil health is improved with organic farming practices solely natural ways square measure employed in organic farming Conventional Farming typical farming makes use of chemicals, synthetics, and different materials to manage weeds and pests typical farming uses unnatural farming ways typical farming use of pesticides has garnered attention towards acceptable levels of toxicity, and whether or not there ought to truly be a suitable level Pesticides employed in typical farming is damaging to your health.
There square measure several different variations between organic and traditional farming, however these appear to be the foremost spoken of with regard to client health.
Theoretically, we have enough land area to grow organic food to feed entire global population.
I cannot find any data to check if we have enough natural resources everywhere to sustain organic farming at the level of conventional farming.
I do not think there is enough nutrient-rich top soil required for organic farming in existing pieces of agricultural land.
The main limitation so far is that, overall, organic yields have been considerably lower than conventional yields .
Which means, we will have to destroy more fertile land (e.g., forests) to increase the output of organic food to match conventionally-grown food.
Comparing the yields of organic and conventional agriculture In order to grow organic food with high yields, farmers have to follow best agricultural management practices to make efficient use of local natural resources.
Will Organic Food Fail to Feed the World?
In fact, more knowledge would be key to any effort to boost organic farming or its yields.
Organic farmers, on the other hand, must learn to manage an entire ecosystem geared to producing food-controlling pests through biological means, using the waste from animals to fertilize fields and even growing one crop amidst another.
"Organic farming is a very knowledge-intensive farming system," Seufert notes.
An organic farmer "needs to create a fertile soil that provides sufficient nutrients at the right time when the crops need them.
Feeding everyone on this planet (i.e.,food security) is entirely different challenge though.
Can organic farmers produce enough food for everybody?
Food security is not only a question of the ability to produce food, but also of the ability to access food.
Global food production is more than enough to feed the global population, the problem is getting it to the people who need it.
Organic agriculture and food security.
Persisting world hunger has demonstrated that agriculture alone (be it conventional or not) cannot alone solve food insecurity.
Still, many questions are asked with regards to the ability of organic agriculture to provide food - and many speculations are made, without any comprehensive data basis.
More thoughts about this question here Can Organic Farming Feed Us All?
Fresh foods are basically non-storable.
Price totally depends on current supply level on the market, and whatever super-food fad is circulating amongst consumers.
Price of organics depends on price of "conventional" chemical grown veggies.
So you need to find your own local ways of using organic principles for cost reduction by using free materials available to you locally.
Other answers have very well explained why organic produce is costly in general.
But, most of the cultivable land in India is by default organic.
Moreover, Farmers have to pay nearly Rs.10,000 ( dollar 200) for a certification process in India and it may take upto 5 years to convert the soil for the full fledged organic crops production.
In short, organic farming uses bio fertilizers and costly methods for pest control like biological control agents.
India may account for 1 - 2% of the total organic produce worldwide.
One of the main reason for organic products so expensive in India , is that the local market is not the target market for the organic farmers in India .
Because, India exports 85% of its organic produce .
Organic farmers in India eye the global market rather than the local market. "
Around 60 per cent of the country's organic products were exported to the European Union, 20 per cent to the US, 5 per cent to Japan and the rest to Canada, Australia and East Asian countries. "
Few years ago, I read that organic tender coconut was priced at Rs.200 ( dollar 5 then), in an export market.
Can we afford Rs.200 for an organic tender coconut?
So I would say, the price factor for Indian organic produce is highly influenced by the lucrative global market, rather than anything else.

But as of now it is impossible to sell organic products at lower costs.
If more and more people switch to organic farming then price might come down coz of the lower demand which will lead to abandoning organic farming again.
Only way is for the people to get used to the slightly higher price of the organic produce.. Also some people charge more than adequate for organic stuff because of the increasing demand and lower supply.. Hope things change for good..
Non-organic foods have a lot of chemicals on the surface and perhaps in the crop itself.
If you buy organic food, you at least reduce the overall amount of chemicals in your blood.
So, this food is heal their .
Some of the copper salts they use in organic crops to spray against insects may also accumulate in your body, but not as much as if you paid no attention to food quality.
The thorny issue of GMO food is a story that is still being investigated.
Frankenstein food comes to mind, because there have never been proper experiments regarding food safety, only so called standard testing procedures mostly on rodents.
Thus, glyphosate ( equal "Roundup" produced by Monsanto) amplifies the damaging effect of environmental toxins and chemical residues from non-organic food that we eat.
Here is a summary of the 10 most common GM foods in the US : Sugar beets, potatoes, corn, tomatoes, squash, golden rice, soybeans, soybean oils, animal feed, salmon.
You see that almost all of our foods are being invaded by genetic engineering.
Conclusion GMO foods may transmit viral particles and Bt toxin, which can cause autoimmune diseases and fertility problems as well as interference with the liver's detoxification system, which causes cancers.
The full health impact is not clear at this point and it may take another 70 years for wheat and another 80 years for GMO foods to find out all the consequences.
Some people have decided not to be part of this mass experiment and rather buy organic foods.
You cannot spot GMO food just by looking and labeling regulations vary between countries.
Even a GMO non-organic (but fresh) tomato is heal their (and cheaper) than a jar of pre-made pasta sauce that claims to be organic and non-GMO.
Because organic food production is an inefficient way of cultivating crops because it yields pathetic outputs in relation to the amount of inputs (labor, land, ect) gone into it.
In our cafeteria is just regular food.
We also like to purchase products that we have a connection to -- we always get great turnout when we have products that come in directly from customers -- that is true whether they are conventional, GMO or organic.
Recent studies are backing up what many thought: organic foods do indeed have a heal their nutritional profile than their conventional counterparts.
Eating organic fruits and vegetables could increase your antioxidant intake by 20-40%.
Organic strawberries have more nutrients and antioxidants than their conventional counterparts.
Organic tomatoes are 50% higher in vitamin C content than conventional tomatoes.
Particularly the big packaged food industry still wants to call the packaged food products with chemical preservatives as Organic.
Organic is a term that certifies an agricultural standard, intended to be free from antibiotics, herbicides and pesticides.
Organic whole foods certainly will not do the harm processed foods with lots of chemicals and preservatives and growth hormones and antibiotics do to you.
Then again, organic sugar, pasta, potatoes, rice, wheat products and corn are also not good for you as they can cause you to become addicted to sugar in its many forms and can lead to over-eating and obesity.
Kalgudi - Helping everyone across the globe with agricultural information You might think organic food would cost less than conventional food since the production is spared the cost of the chemicals, synthetic pesticides, and antibiotics.
Yet organic products typically cost 20 percent to 100 percent more than their conventionally produced equivalents.
Here are the top factors contributing to the high price of organic food 1.
Without them, organic farmers have to hire more workers for tasks like hand-weeding, cleanup of polluted water, and the remediation of pesticide contamination.
Demand overwhelms supply Organic farmland only accounts for 0.9 percent of total worldwide farmland, and organic farms tend to produce less than conventional farms.
Higher cost of fertilizer for organic crops Sewage sludge and chemical fertilizers might not be something you want in your food, but conventional farmers use them because they do not cost much and are cheap to transport.
Organic farmers eschew these inexpensive solutions in order to keep their crops natural and instead use compost and animal manure, which is more expensive to ship.
Crop rotation Instead of using chemical weed-killers, organic farmers conduct sophisticated crop rotations to keep their soil healthy and prevent weed growth.
After harvesting a crop, an organic farmer may use that area to grow "cover crops," which add nitrogen to the soil to benefit succeeding crops.
Post-harvest handling cost In order to avoid cross-contamination, organic produce must be separated from conventional produce after being harvested.
Organic crops, however, are handled and shipped in smaller quantities since organic farms tend to produce less, and this results in higher costs.
Additionally, organic farms are usually located farther from major cities, increasing the shipping cost.
Since organic farmers do not use these, their losses are higher, which costs the farmer more and increases the cost to the consumer.
Additionally, without all the chemical preservatives added to conventional foods, organic foods face a shorter storage time and shelf life.
Organic food grows more slowly Time is money.
Not only are organic farms typically smaller than conventional ones, but they also, on average, take more time to produce crops because they refrain from using the chemicals and growth hormones used by conventional farmers.
Egg color only depends on the breed of chicken, not whether the egg is organic.
Smaller, organic farms typically charge more for their eggs and thus can use a breed that lays fewer eggs.
3) Usage of chemicals heats up the soil, kills microbes ( which actually do the work of producing food for the plants).
Organic/Natural Farming is sustainable provided some patience and efforts are taken to understand our soil, climate, plants and how the ecosystem works.
1) Multicropping is mandatory in organic as crops complement each other and some crops are used as bait to indicate pest attacks early.
Organic farms tend to have many life forms in birds, insects, rodents, snakes etc.
The food pyramid is in full flow and most of the "bad" insects are the primary food.
4) Forget organic premium; most of the produce can be sold locally at Grade A rates as traders know it is good quality.
6) Livestock is essential for organic farming, which serves as short term income generators as well as insurance for the farmers for urgent needs.
Industrialization has actually brought down organic prices considerably; the price differentials used to be even higher.
Organic agricultural methods are internationally regulated and legally enforced by many nations, based in large part on the standards set by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM).
It is currently booming in india , and states such as sikkim and kerala have planned to shift fully in organic cultivation since 2015 and 2016 respectively.
There are many companies which promotes organic farming "Terragreen".
The company also has the distinction of being led by women entrepreneurs who firmly believe in healthy and ecologically balanced farming practices, or simply, organic farming.
As per my knowledge in India every State has hundreds of organic farmers.
As I am citizen of Chhattisgarh then Adoption And Certification Of Organic Farming "Chhattisgarh"is required for that.
Supply of organic certified Bio-fertilizers and Bio-pesticides.
To improve the skill of farmers for adoption of Organic Farming.
Hope this answer will give you direction to start organic farming in successful way.
organic food producing company based in Hyderabad that believes in the concept of natural food, or simply - as nature intended.
We produce 100% organic food from our extensive organic farms, besides being aided by organic farming communities across India.
As farmers ourselves, we have a hands-on approach towards organic farming, and have been actively promoting it over the years for the sake of a safer environment and a heal their you.
Terra Greens Organic is the result of persistent campaigning and encouraging farmers disillusioned by conventional farming methods to switch to a more sustainable, indigenous and an eco-friendly form of farming.
Fresh made food that feels local and healthy, you can eat it in the market or on their patio that each store has created for people to just sit and eat.
Most grocery chains have a hot food section but no where to eat it - you feel you have to take it to go, versus enjoy.
All in all Whole Foods has created an environment that is a destination versus a stop on a Saturday to-do list.
Even if you accept that GM food is a problem or risk to society, and that investing in such companies is unethical, that does not by any stretch mean that every GM food is automatically bad and every non-GM food is good.
An organic, fair trade, locally sourced, etc., hamburger chain is probably a lot worse for health and environment than a GM watermelon.
A giant organic factory farm in China is probably worse on all counts than a project to develop pest-resistant GM seeds.
Extracted information follows: Full article here: Page on ndnr.com summary The results of selecting for larger produce and of faster growth through fertilization have cause a fairly massive nutrient decline in conventionally grown foods... to say nothing of the pesticides used (remember how long they told us that DDT was"safe"?).
Extracted Information from link: Nutrient Levels in Organic Foods Until recently, the primary value of organic foods resided in just a few factors: 1) Lack of certain undesirable constituents, mainly pesticides, herbicides, petroleum-based fertilizers and genetically-modified organisms 2) Reduction in environmental degradation by not adding toxins to air, water and soil 3) Support of heal their , pesticide-free environments for farm workers However, organic gardeners and farmers have always suspected an added value of organically grown foods - higher levels of nutrients.
Dr. Benbrook's research has established that organically grown vegetables and fruits contain higher levels of nutrients than their conventional counterparts.
Organic foods were found to be clearly higher in antioxidants, vitamin C, nitrates and some polyphenols; and moderately higher in protein.
Plant-based organic foods were consistently and clearly more nutrient dense, while animal-based organic foods were not consistently superior.
Within these studies, 236 valid matched pairs (or types) of measurements were identified which included both conventional and organic food samples.
There were 135 study-crop combinations covered in the 97 studies; within these 97 studies, 94 were identified as valid, where there were good comparisons between conventional and organic food.
In 145 of the 236 matched pairs (61%), the organic foods were more nutrient dense.
In 87 of the 236 matched pairs (37%), conventional foods were more nutrient dense.
In three-fourths of the cases, polyphenols and antioxidants were greater in organic than conventional foods.
Conventional food samples showed higher levels of potassium, phosphorus and protein in three-fourths of the cases where conventional foods were more nutrient dense.
Nutrient levels were on average 31% or more higher in organic foods than conventional in 25% of the study samples.
Across all 236 matched pairs and 11 nutrients, the nutritional premium of the organic food averaged 25%.
Antioxidants Numerous studies have found higher levels of antioxidants in organic produce than in conventional.
Organic tomatoes contained 79% and 97% higher levels of quercetin and kaempferol, respectively, in a long-term study conducted at the University of California - Davis (Mitchell AE et al., 2007).
An Italian research team seeking to create a test to distinguish between organic and conventional oranges found that vitamin C levels were higher in organic oranges (Tarozzi et al., 2006).
Organic red wines contain higher levels of resveratrol, polyphenols and other antioxidants (Di Renzo et al., 2007).
Benbrook's team found that, in general, organically grown produce contains 30% higher levels of antioxidants than conventional produce.
no.... but it also depends on what "organic" means.
Some companies are "organic" and that just means they do not use chemicals... some however, use more "traditional" farming methods which use various methods for putting nutrients back into the soil.
pesticides and chemical fertilizers do damage the plant and get into the food you eat.
No, There are real benefits of organic food for people and the environment.
There is no nutritional advantage to organic.
And if you think that organic farming is not commercial, you are ignoring the fact that it is a huge industry, every bit as commercial as any other.
100% I do not want to let on that organic food is bad or any worse than conventionally farmed food.
Now there is arguably some extent to which the myths about organic food were technically true when the movement first began about 45 plus years ago, but they have not been for a very long time.
That said, I would stop just short of saying that organic food is actually a fraudulent enterprise.
Though there are groups like Greenpeace who do deliberately and brazenly lie to people about organic vs conventional and especially GMOs in the interest of advancing their agenda, but Greenpeace is not really an industry player.
To distill it down to a single point - and yes, I know this will inevitably lead to an oversimplification, but that is what will happen when you try to distill anything down to a single statement - Organic food is not a movement based on food value; it is a movement based on revulsion of science of technology.
The simple reason why it works is because the marketing message of organic food evokes fanciful imagery of the "olden days" against the fearsome images of poorly understood concepts of modern technology and the hatred of big megacorporate interests.
People think of technological advances in agriculture like GMOs and they picture mad scientists The latter of which is a bit hilarious since the organic food market is not dominated by your neighborhood farmers. it is dominated by the likes of Wal-Mart, Costco, Kraft, Kellog's, etc.
First of all, let's begin with the belief that organic food is better for you - that is simply untrue.
An organic tomato grown in Florida is going to have poorer nutrient quality to a conventional tomato grown in California - that is just down to soil.
Moreover, the techniques that farmers use to manage soil quality and account for weather and so on are the same for organic vs. conventional farming techniques.
While an organic farmer can make a little more per kilo of yield, the total weight for a given amount of input labor and operating costs is less as well, so farmers do not actually make good money on organic.
As far as taste/flavor goes, studies show that organic vs. conventional is basically a tie.
Moreover, there are also studies that strongly indicate that the perceived flavor advantage of organic food is entirely down to expectations.
In blind tests, things come out basically even (again, assuming all else equal), but if people are told that one is organic and one is conventional, the one they were told is organic tends to win, even if the subjects of the study were actually misled.
Also, many people believe that organic food means no pesticides or herbicides.
As it so happens, this is actually less "green", because naturally sourced pesticides and herbicides tend to carry all sorts of impurities, and offer lower efficacy, which actually means that organic farmers have to use more of it to get their yields up to manageable levels. Synthetic pesticides and herbicides are more effective, can be used in smaller quantities, and are higher purity, which actually makes them many times safer and cause less contaminated runoff.
In fact, all outbreaks of food-borne illness from vegetables sold in the U.S. in the last 30 years have been connected exclusively to organic vegetables.
The only legitimate illness prevention that organic offers (and more specifically, it is only there in the sense that it is an explicit requirement of organic meats) is that livestock feed cannot contain any animal byproducts, which thereby reduces the risk of Mad Cow disease. there is really nothing else you can explicitly tie to organic food.
Similarly, the notion of no antibiotics or hormones in organic is also a myth.
Also, a meat that is certified organic does not mean that all of the feed stock is organically grown; it is around 80%, and exceptions can be made if there are known nutrient deficiencies in the feed stock.
There are some people who believe that buying organic helps small or local farmers, and that too is a myth.
As mentioned before, organic is now a huge industry, and it bears all the same "evil corporate" characteristics one would associate with conventional "factory" farming.
While organic growers ostensibly make more per unit weight than conventional farmers, the fact that they are cut off from a host of technological advances means that it is not even a theoretical possiblity for them to obtain equivalent yields on the same resource input.
It turns out in practice that for all farm owners who own both conventional and organic plots, they make less money per acre on organic (again, assuming apples to apples, of course).
There is some degree of correlation between organic and lower incidence of cruel treatment of livestock.
it is debatable how much of this is related to the political image maintenance of organic food, and how much is because it is merely possible since organic is still a smaller subset of the overall food market.
Buying organic or pushing for cruelty-free practices in all kinds of farming?
From life, we can find that organic food is becoming more and more popular.
But at the same time, the safety of food industry has long been an issue of consumer concern all over the world.
The organic food market is all about making more money, not being healthy or "natural".
Foods that are labelled as organic pay a premium to be certified as such and they also charge a lot more.
Non-organic farm products are nearly as unadulterated as organic products, they are just cheaper.
Most of the time there is no added value to buying organic other than a nice happy feeling and a lighter wallet for you to carry around.
Whole Foods successfully competes mainly by having a wider selection of foods that are perceived to be healthy.
Here are some examples of things you can buy at Whole Foods that are hard to find elsewhere: 100% grass-fed organic beef organic almonds, pecans and any type of organic nut you want a wider selection of organic fruits and vegetables than competing markets many hard-to-find brands of organic cereals many brands organic fruit juices you will not find anywhere else for any type of grocery Whole Foods will have some unique options Whole Foods has a large prepared foods section that enables shoppers to buy food that has already been cooked.
Their prepared foods section is typically much larger than that of competitors It typically has more choices of prepared foods Its options are typically heal their Whole Foods also carries vitamins and personal care products that some believe are heal their for you.
Whole Foods is squarely focused on its target market: people who care about health and believe certain types of harder-to-find foods are better for health people who want prepared foods people who want vitamins and personal care products they perceive as heal their people who are willing to pay more for the convenience of finding all of the above in one place
I actually think of 'natural foods' as being organic, minimally processed and without additives.
Since Whole Foods carries much in the may of non-organic, highly processed and foods with added sweeteners, I do not consider it a 'natural food' store.
That said, I love Whole Foods and their effort to carry, provide and guide the market toward more healthful and natural choices.
I have a whole foods that is the closest grocery to me Sometimes they have meat cuts or seafood that I typically do not see at publix or Kroger.
They also have a good beer and cheese selection and interesting International foods too.
Whole foods is a little too expensive to be a regular stop for my budget.
I also do not buy the organic marketing/anti GMO stance they take, but I will tolerate it if I am in there on occasion.
However, there is one thing I love at whole foods, and that is the hot bar.
Whole foods's hot bar has items I like, and enough variety that I can change up from the usual greasy fried junk (some shift mates frequently eat chick fil a or zaxbys 3 times a week).
Those are the main reasons I occasionally go to whole foods.
If you eat/buy organic to avoid industrial chemical and pesticide residues, then buying the foods that are on the current (2015) "Clean 15" list of commercially grown foods is an affordable option if you do not want to pay for organic.
The fruits and vegetables on the list have low to undetectable levels of heavy metals, industrial chemicals, radiation, and pesticide residues, even though they are not grown or certified "organic".
it is important to note that even in organic farming, non-synthetic pesticides are used when necessary.
It is wise to double check the current Clean 15 list at regular intervals, as the foods on the list are subject to change with growing methods and seasonal production.
Buy organic varieties of these crops if you want to avoid GE produce.
These are also within the same category as the "Clean 15": When buying non-organic commercially grown foods, it is best to avoid GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms), or *Genetically Engineered crops.
that is not ethical: scaring people for no reason, and at a cost of billions to enforce the label law, helps no one except the organic farmers and corporations like Whole Foods.
There are no long-term studies proving the safety of treif and haram (non-kosher and non-halal respectively) foods, though, like GMOs, we know they are safe because people have been eating them for years, and there is no mechanism by which they would be less healthy than kosher or halal foods.
it is great if GMO-free products want to voluntarily label themselves as GMO-free or organic.
I exclusively eat organic when ever possible.
When it comes to labeling GMO foods, I am personally indifferent.
There is so much GMO food on the market that I just assume everything is GMO unless it specifically says it is not.
Back to your original question: Should genetically modified food be labeled worldwide?
So lets say we do label GMO foods.
A typical organic crop is 2% or more GMO DNA.
Almost every processed food contains GMO products.
The food you grow in your damn garden is GMO now.
Labeling food as GMO now makes as much sense as requiring Zephyrhills to put "Product is wet" on bottles of water.
(Organic does not mean that less harm is caused to the environment.
Genetically modified produce cannot be labeled organic, hybrids or crosses that do not involved laboratory manipulations of the genes are not commonly considered Genetically Modified, they are usually referred to as hybrids or by their varietal name.
Eating organically does not have to impact your wallet, as long as you know how to engage in some smart shopping techniques.
Try some of the following: 1) When it comes to organic produce, buy in season or buy frozen.
This may come as a surprise, but there are lots of suppliers who will sell you both fresh and frozen organic produce and meats and ship it directly to your door.
Organic grains, beans and pastas all make quick and healthy meals.
Have a few organic canned items around too.
Keeping an eye on sales at Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and other supermarkets that specialize in healthy organic stuff is a key element to getting the best for your buck.
Suggest finding a local grower/farmer who will sell you their organic fruit and vegetables - and hopefully their grass-fed, free-range meat and poultry too.
Your local grower is likely to have less mark up on their organic goods than the big stores and they will probably provide delivery as well, which is saving you even more money.
You want to maximise the life of your organic stash.
All food is organic.
I think you might be confusing a farm method and organic certification.
Anything you can taste is a chemical and even organic certified contains chemicals and even pesticides as 1 plants produce their own pesticide properties and 2 organic uses pesticides just like all agriculture!
My dad grew up on a farm in China, and as my sister and I grew up, it seemed only natural that we should take advantage of his expertise, and grow our own organic food (rather than source it from overpriced groceries).
I get fresh produce from a CSA (community supported agriculture) membership and then choose carefully when shopping in a supermarket (in order of priority: local, in season, organically grown, price).
I have the time (no kids) and the financial resources to be able to do this, so I like to think of it as doing my part to help bring down the prices of fresh and organically grown food for everyone.
Maybe that is a foolish rationalization of sometimes paying more, but I hate the idea of chemicals that cannot be safely applied without a full protective suit and respirator on anyone's food!
Ironically, that is even truer with industrial organics, which have optimized to produce the same look and taste.
Sikkim is now a 100% organic state, with no chemical pesticides or fertilizers and no GMOs.
This matters because it shows that organic food in an entire region is possible.
Now, other people in India and throughout the world are learning from Sikkim's success, and beginning to ask, "Could organic food succeed in other areas, too?" How Sikkim became a fully organic place In 2003, due to chemically intensive, conventional farming methods, the Himalayan state's food production faced serious environmental and health problems.
As a solution, the Chief Minister of Sikkim, Pawan Chamling, announced his vision for Sikkim to be India's first organic state.
Twelve years later, by the end of 2015, all Sikkim's farms were certified organic by an independent certi for your information ng body.
On January 18, 2016, at Sikkim's Organic Festival, the Prime Minister of India declared the state fully organic.
The Sikkim Organic Mission Project, the state's organic policy, spread awareness about why, what, and how the mission would be accomplished.
Organic farming was added as a subject in school.
Farmers attended required training on organic farming led by organic experts and scientists.
The Sikkim government helped make organic seeds and manures more available, helped farmers market their produce, and even sent some farmers outside the state for advanced training.
Why organic food is important Organic agriculture is important for our health and the future of our world for many reasons.
Organic farming is also better suited to climate change, protects biodiversity, enhances soil fertility, and, to top it off, organic foods are more nutritious and taste better.
But without pesticides and other tools known for producing high-yield agriculture, would organic food really be able to produce enough food to feed people?
Many studies from around the world show that organic farms can produce about as much if not more food than conventional farms.
And in places where most of the world's hungry live, yield gaps for organic food disappear.
But could the best way to preserve our water supplies, be with organic farming?
Organic soil is better able to hold onto water because it uses organic material.
Therefore, plants have more access to water, and they produce more food.
A way to make organic food cheap Organic food sometimes costs more.
But experts say the way to make organic food cheap is to get everybody on board.
One entrepreneur in India who has experience in agriculture put it like this: "What happens ordinarily in organic is that a retailer deals with small quantities from a wide range of farmers.
When a state is 100% organic, then the costs that go into segregating, packaging, labeling, and differential pricing, are saved.
When everything is organic, the price automatically falls." How Sikkim is benefitting from becoming an organic state Sikkim's transition to an organic state is good for public health and the environment in the area.
Guests can stay in organic villages, where they are able to enjoy the abundant natural beauty and eat fresh, organic meals.
Sikkim organic retail stores offering pulses, rice, mandarin oranges, ginger, cardamom, and turmeric have been set up by the government in New Delhi.
Due to the surge in demand for Sikkim's organic produce, farmers are now earning 20%more.
Contrary to popular belief, "organic" can actually be worse on the environment, and also be more "dangerous" to consume (depending on your definition of "dangerous", of course.
Organic farming does not achieve the same yields as more modern farming techniques, so more land is used to grow the same amount of food.
Couple that with the odd definitions of organic in many countries and it often means that harsher, less targeted poisons (like Rotenone) are used for pest control, because they are more "natural".
Because these pesticides are less targeted, they have a tendency to cause a much greater environmental effect, like killing of beneficial predator species, often resulting in a *higher* usage of pesticides than in a non organic farm.
Non organic farms can use an engineered pesticide that more effectively targets just the pest species.
This can result in less over all environmental impact for a given unit of food.
You can of course find local organic farms that use no pesticides whatsoever, just do not expect to find their produce on the shelf at Safeway, because the food will not be all that attractive to your average consumer.
Now there are of course some very good benefits to organic food as well.
Organic foods usually have a wider variety of cultivars, resulting in more variety of taste and texture for a given food type.
My migraines reduced dramatically after I began taking magnesium every day (I take 125 gms), made sure I ate foods with B2 every day (almonds, eggs, spinach), gave up soy, kept up the protein, had very little coffee.
I am not sure what you mean by 'organic medicine,' but I guess you want headaches to go away and these things have worked for me.
Perhaps food is the best organic medicine.
Because organic food has lesser produtivity compared the common foods.
While you get 100 units production of organic tomatoes, you get 1000 units of tomatoes with pesticide planting, which protect the plant against plagues.
And, the durability and sensivity of organic foods makes it harder to transport and conservate.
Is made in bulk, yet majority of the product expires, so expired products are migrated into the cost of organic inventory, raising the prices.
In other words, you are paying for the risk the business owner goes through the provide an organic product.
It is true that the Authenticity of organic products - whether it is organic or not - is difficult to trust, but more than that, I believe it is more important for us to understand the meaning of 'organic' rather than it just being defined by some 'regulatory' board.
There is also a lot of assumption on how we actually come to the conclusion that the seller or the farmer might have bribed the so called 'regulatory board' for organic certification.
Legally, there is nothing as organic which exists - at least, in India.
has a few clauses which can be used to question the seller in case and sue in case you find out the product they are selling is not what they claim it to be - however, there is no clear definition of the word organic.
However, despite the absence of regulations - the picture is not as grim - thanks to the organic movement.
There are norms(international and national)- like NPOP, BioSuisse, USDA, - which have set the standards for someone who wants to go organic (From conventional) - and there are agencies (mostly private) which conform to these guidelines and certify producers based on a fee.
Also, for a country like India, where there are many farmers who have very small land holdings and not good access to information and funds - it might never be possible for many farmers to get the certification despite having organic practices in their farming (I personally know 4 such farmers who practice organic just because they believe in it and they do not find it important for someone else to 'certify' their produce)... For this too, there is a low cost certification method which exists - called PGS (Participatory guarantee scheme) .
Though PGS is not recognized by the certi for your information ng agencies - some of the best organic farmer groups I know in India are PGS certified.
To answer how organic food can be made cheap?
I know some families in my town have tied up with farmers close to us and they have made an agreement with them to buy from them - and they also participate in planning their sowing... consult them on organic practices..
This way - not only you get to know how your food is being produced - you get cheaper food, and farmers get better prices too, In Kolkata and Jamshedpur, there are 'haats/ market' organized once in a week or so .. where a group of farmers bring their produce and sell it directly to customers - the transportation and rent for the place is managed by the cooperative's funds (ngo shyamoli) .
Both these groups are consulted on their organic practices by the group of consumers/ local volunteers.
In a normal 'big city' situation too, there are ways through which you can be more assured of someone's claim to be organic or not.
Organic brands - if they want to build trust - should either show certification or should be completely transparent - to the extent of percentage of price going to the farmers - visits to the farmer group
I also think there are good answers here: What are the biggest misconceptions about organic food?
And finally, I will build off what Bruce Ames has to say about all the worries about chemicals (and organic food).
He also mentions organic foods, calling it "nonsense" from a consumer health standpoint, though he does allude that for agricultural workers, it can be important.
My point in all this is that if organic has any benefits, it is insignificant.
If you are shopping in the Western world, you can be confident your food is pretty safe, no matter what you eat.
The differences are insignificant considering the wide array of agricultural practices you might define as "organic" or "conventional," and it is insignificant considering the many other unhealthy things we all do and eat.
Until the 20th century, all farming was organic, and the record of famine, erosion, plant disease, and permanently degraded soils is irrefutable.
Modern organic farmers in rich countries farm in a very responsible manner.
But the high priests of the organic movement somehow think seed varieties male a difference too, even though almost none of the crop seeds in use today would have occurred naturally.
However, because of reduced yields, the same amount of land, water, fuel, and labor is used to produce less food.
All vegetables are really organic in the strict chemical definition of that term, but if you mean have been grown with our using synthetic pesticides or fertiliser, then it depends where you live.
Certainly in the UK and Germany and probably in the EU generally, there are very strict rules and you can not legally market your product as organic if you have not adhered to them.
I do not believe that the term organic has a strict legal definition and as such it would probably depend on which state you were in.
The term Organic is protected by the USDA at the federal level in much the same fashion as in the EU.
The standards in the US are part of the National Organic Program (NOP) and are strictly regulated.
As an organic farmer, I cannot use the "O" word to describe my produce or practices unless I acquire organic certification.
"Organic" is only part of the picture - you have to be aware of country of origin and practices in that country.
For instance, I would mostly prefer to buy conventional food from the US or Australia/New Zealand to buying organic food from China.
Yes, the use of GMO crops produces a significant improvement for the environment, as well as increased yield of nutritionally-denser foods grown where they could not be grown before: AgBioForum 8(2 and 3): GM Crops: The Global Economic and Environmental Impact Altered pesticide use on transgenic crops and the associated general impact from an environmental perspective Yield Effects of Genetically Modified Crops in Developing Countries However, the other aspects of organic farming also seem to have a positive impact on the environment: Environmental Impact of Different Agricultural Management Practices: Conventional vs. Organic Agriculture although of course that does not take into account the urgent need for the increased yields from non-organic farming, in terms of feeding the entire population of the world with a nutritionally-adequate diet.
So I guess the answer is to use organic methods on GM crops.
In case the question changes, the one I answered was: "Is there a significant difference in the environmental impacts of organic vs GMO agricultural practices?"
In general organic is worse for the environment and GMO better.
Organic methods are typically low yield, which means they have a bigger resource impact, including the amount of land required.
Studies show there is no significant different in the nutritional value of organic food compared to non-organic.
No studies can confirm whether or not the pesticides and fertilizers used in non-organic foods is harmful for human consumption, for now we assume no because its difficult to feed the population of the world so we use techniques to yeild more crop by land mass.
Personally I prefer organic, though I am not on a fully organic diet.
For the 3rd reason is probably why Debbie thinks organic celery tastes better.
Same goes for watermelon, organic water melon tastes better and has a firmer texture.
Further more, I prefer local food.
Organic is a scam 80% of the time.
Archer Farms "organic" food is a joke.
Look on the packaging and you will notice food additives, where as these are synthetic compounds.
Organic certifications are not strict enough, and if you have something like canned green beans that are "organic" they may still have non-organic ingredients or additives, however the green beans themselves are organic.
I buy local because nutrition in food degrades over time, and I want to buy from a farmer that cares.
Not only does the produce not travel as far, but the people who make your food actually care about your food and enjoy doing what they do.
Probably the biggest key to having more nutritious food is growing it yourself or buying local, nutrition degrades with time, and nutrition is at its peak when the plant is ripe.
Almost all vegetables and fruits in the super market are artificially ripened, even if its labeled organic.
Just buy local, talk to the farmer, see where your food is coming from.
But do not trust everything with "Organic" labelled on it !
Many organic dairy products available in the market are either UHT or treated some how to ensure longer shelf life.
So go for only FRESH Organic milk.
The genuine certified Organic Milk from recognized farms is produced without the use of pesticides, growth hormones, genetically modified organisms.
FRESH Organic milk has more fat-soluble nutrients - omega-3 fatty acid, Vitamin E and beta-carotene - than non-organic and long lasting organic milk.
Obviously FRESH Organic milk tastes better; milk as it used to taste, with a clear, pure and fresh flavor.
Here's a great example for a genuine certified organic FRESH milk from UK'Darlington Farms' by Acorn Dairy.
It is certified Organic by the UK Soil Association, Red Tractor certified - UK's recognised farm and quality food assurance scheme.
This question probably makes the assumption that organic food has quality or health benefits.
I lay them out in my post here: Organic vs conventional food Quality-wise, people may argue they can taste the difference.
This, however, is a poor way to truly determine nutrition or truly, even taste perception, as being told the food is organic makes people rate it higher .
Firstly, it is important to note that organic farmers also use pesticides, and conventional farmers also minimise pesticide use through Integrated Pest Management ( IPM , natural predator insects, crop rotation, cover crops, etc).
In this regard organic pesticides are no more benign than conventional , you can see comparisons with conventional and organic pesticides and other everyday chemicals in a table in this post: The dose makes the poison.
A comment on that study: Until recently, nobody bothered to look at natural chemicals (such as organic pesticides), because it was assumed that they posed little risk.
More on organic vs synthetic pesticides: Some organic approved pesticides are very benign (low hazard) materials, but so are a great many of the synthetic pesticides used by conventional farmers.
Some organic-approved pesticides are slightly to moderately toxic.
There are many pesticides that are used by both conventional and organic growers.
Some of the pesticides commonly used on organic crops are applied at rather high rates (pounds per treated acre).
In any case, organic-approved pesticides definitely leave residues on treated crops by the time they reach the consumer.
- Why You Can Feel Guilt-free Buying Non-Organic Produce Unfortunately, we are in the dark about organic pesticide residues.
Unfortunately, I learned that this new testing program is only there to encourage compliance with the organic rules, not to document anything about relative residue levels.
There will be no testing for organically approved pesticides.
From: <url> " There has not been, and still is not any testing of the organic pesticide residue.
The cost of buying organic is felt by your wallet and the environment, as organic farming at present unfortunately exerts a greater toll on our natural resources than conventional farming - it demands more land, and produces more nitrogen run-off for instance.
Meanwhile, what would be best for the environment were to only choose to buy organic for those crops where yield is not much lower (lower yields equal more wasted resources), or even higher than conventional.
This recent overview of US data by Steve Savage in Forbes: The Lower Productivity Of Organic Farming: A New Analysis And Its Big Implications has some good tables for more information about that.
It seems to suggest that in the US organic artichokes, peas, sweet corn, sweet potatoes and snap beans may carry a smaller environmental burden than most other organic vegetables.
The other show 10 - 71 % lower yields than conventionally grown varieties, which means that more labour, resources and land is needed for organic farming to get the same result as for conventional.
Organic farming is a term which has become popular very recently, however there is nothing new in the buzz word.
So my answer to your question is Yes you can implement organic farming in your place.
In case you are looking for ways in which you can get healthy vegetables for yourself and your family, then all you need to do is start organic vegetable gardening in your premises.
Organic vegetable gardening is easy to do, cost-effective and provides you with vegetables which are oozing with nutrients.
Also research shows that organic vegetables helps in keeping many lifestyle related and chronic diseases at bay.
There are studies which show that organic food is the best defense against your kids premature puberty.
And most of all, organic gardening is eco-friendly.
There is zero health or nutritional benefit to be gained by spending twice what you need to on organic.
Relax, wash that lettuce, and enjoy your food.
According to the National Pesticide Information Center: By the time food reaches your grocery store, pesticide residues are generally well below the legal limit, or tolerance.
However, there are several healthy, sensible food practices that will allow you to further reduce your exposure to any pesticide residues that may remain on your food.
Source: Food Safety - National Pesticide Information Center Some of the sensible practices they mention include: Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables to minimize the potential of increased exposure to a single pesticide.
Thoroughly wash all produce, even that which is labeled organic and that which you plan to peel.

There are historic and persistent reasons why people worry about pesticides ( <url> " I do not buy organic, but I understand why my mom's generation worries so much about pesticides.
The sweeping public opinion that organic food is heal their than conventional food is quite strong, and is the main reason for increase in its demand over the past 5-6 years.
This article will explain what organic food is, how it is beneficial and what are the standards for the same.
This is to substantiate the public opinion that we have on organic food being good for the health.
First of all, there is a small amount of scientific evidence to show that organic food is better in quality than conventional food.
Scientific research conducted thus far on various organic food items has not been able to give strong evidence about the superiority of organic food over non-organic food.
As a result, even the FDA and the USDA clearly mention that non-organic food is as healthy as organic food.
However, there are some scientific studies that have proved organic milk and organic tomatoes to be better than the non-organic varieties.
Studies are also ongoing about a variety of other types of organic food that may have additional health benefits compared to the non-organic varieties.
According to the researchers at the Danish Institute of Agricultural Research at the University of Aberdeen and the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research, organic milk is heal their than non-organic milk, since organic cows are pasture grazed which results in the better quality of milk.
Organic Tomatoes According to a 10-year study conducted by the University of California, Davis, organic tomatoes are produced in an environment that has a lower nutrient supply since nitrogen-rich chemical fertilizers are not added.
This leads to an excessive formation of antioxidants, such as quercetin (79% higher) and kaempferol (97% higher) in organic tomatoes.
These studies have increased the hopes of numerous people who strongly believe that mankind should stop using chemical fertilizers and pesticides and shift to more sustainable organic farming practices.
There are many studies that prove that there is some pesticide and fertilizer contamination in non-organic food, and there are others which claim that organic food is not healthy because they contain harmful bacteria and viruses because of not using strong chemicals to protect against these toxic substances.
Health Benefits Of Organic Food In general, organic food consumers, manufacturers, and farmers strongly believe that organic food has the following benefits compared to conventional food.
Antioxidant Capacity A number of studies have been completed regarding the effects of antioxidants derived from organic foods on your overall health, and the predominant results have shown that antioxidants tend to have more of an impact when they come from organic foods.
This may be due to the fact that foreign chemicals are not negatively interacting with the different vitamins, minerals, and organic compounds that are so essential for the positive impact of fruits and vegetables in the prevention of things like cancer, heart disease, premature aging, vision problems, and cognitive malfunction.
Recent research suggests that choosing organic food can lead to increased intake of nutritionally desirable antioxidants and reduced exposure to toxic heavy metals.
Pesticide Reduction One of the major complaints that organic food consumers cite when choosing organic over non-organic is the presence of pesticides.
This is an unnatural mineral compound that is not required by humans, but more than 80% of this material in our bodies comes from eating pesticide-coated foods.
Organophosphorus has been connected to a number of developmental problems, including autism and ADHD, so those organic food lovers do have a pretty strong argument in this case.
To be fair, many people do choose to go organic to make sure that their children grow up healthy and unaffected by the toxins of the world during their developmental years.

In animal testing genetically modified food showed a major reduction in immune system strength, an increase in birth mortality, as well as in certain sexual dysfunctions, cancers, and sensitivity to allergens.
Although there are some good things about genetically modified food, organic food advocates point to the lack of concrete details about the long-term effects.
However, non-organic food sources, particularly livestock and feed houses, also use antibiotics to feed their animals.
Organic food growers and dairy farmers do not use antibiotics in their processes.
Also see Best 5 Organic Food and Grocery Stores in Manchester, NH Top 6 Organic and Health Food Stores in Petaling Jaya Overall Health Since organic food is not prepared using chemical fertilizers, it does not contain any traces of these strong chemicals and might not affect the human body in negative ways.
Natural fertilizers, like manure, work perfectly fine, and organic farmers are happy to use this smellier, yet safer, form of fertilizer.
Better Taste Some people strongly believe that organic food tastes better than conventional food.
Furthermore, organic food is often sold locally, resulting in availability of fresh produce in the market, which usually does taste better than produce that has been frozen, shipped, and transported across long distances.
Environmental Safety As harmful chemicals are not used in organic farming, there is minimal soil, air and water pollution; thus ensuring a safer and heal their world for future generations to live in.
Animal Welfare Animal welfare is an important aspect of producing organic milk, organic meat, organic poultry, and organic fish.
People feel happy that the animals are not confined to a miserable caged life when they eat organic animal products.
The below frequently asked questions will help you understand organic food and its benefits in a better way What is Organic Food?
On an overall basis, organic food is food prepared and processed without using any chemicals.
That is, organic food production does not involve the use of chemical fertilizers, chemical pesticides, or chemical preservatives.
Normally people believe that organic food is better for your health than conventional food.
However, the USDA and the FDA clearly state that conventional food is as healthy as organic food.
Scientific research has also not been able to conclusively prove that organic food is heal their than conventional food because there has been counter research too to prove conventional food is better than organic one.
The exceptions are organic milk and organic tomatoes.
Recent studies on organic milk and organic tomatoes have shown that these food products are heal their than non-organic milk and non-organic tomatoes, respectively.
Organic food can be identified with the help of an organic logo on the packet.
It is illegal to sell non-organic food with an organic label.
Yes, organic food normally costs 20% to 100% more than conventional food.
Many parents believe that organic food is safer for their children, since it does not contain any chemical pesticides and fertilizers.
So far, scientific research has proven this only for organic milk and organic tomatoes.
Organic milk has more omega-3, CLA, vitamins, and antioxidants than non-organic milk.
Similarly, organic tomatoes have more antioxidants than non-organic tomatoes.
While the regulations vary from country to country, in the U.S., organic crops must be grown without the use of synthetic pesticides, bioengineered genes (GMOs), petroleum-based fertilizers, and sewage sludge-based fertilizers.
Organic livestock raised for meat, eggs, and dairy products must have access to the outdoors and be given organic feed.
Actually i see there is a lot of hype created for organic vegetables , fruits and food stuff.
organic vegetables and fruits are beleived to be grown without the use of pesticides and fertilizers but i doubt how much is that possible?
And i have also observed the taste difference between organic and the conventional products.
They say organic produce is good for the body in the long run.
In my 25 years as an organic farmer I have never used a pesticide of any sort.
I thought I did not like them much until I began eating organic for certain foods.
non organic cucumbers (skin on or off) taste chemical and bitter to me from numerous different sources (Kroger, restaurants, Panera)-I do not pretend to know the reason.
Organic from several different providers have lacked the bitterness as well as the 'chemical' taste and are sweeter like a low sugar melon to my palate.
For most fruits and veg, my experience is that the strain of the plant has more influence than farming method on quality of taste-a mass market strain of something might be chosen more for shelf life or appearance than flavor but the organic strains seem to be more often chosen for flavor due to the marketing approach being different.
I would not personally buy ultra-pastuerized milk, even if it was organic.
This is why in blind tests, non-organic food often performs better.
Organic food can taste bland as it is not enhanced by artificial additives.
You can still get fresh food, organic or not, but in the 1950's it would have been more commonplace that any given diner dealt with fresher ingredients.
There are ranches that produce grass-fed beef but do not go through the rigorous requirements to get the organic label.
that is going to produce a bigger taste difference from typical supermarket beef than organic beef that is been finished (fattened) on organic corn.
And much of what you get at a farmers' market will be excellent but not organic, because compliance with the organic regime can be prohibitively expensive for a small farmer.
Some organic products happen to also be locally-grown, grass-fed, etc.
There may be environmental reasons to prefer the organic, but I think they are hard to quantify.
If there is a taste difference it has nothing to do with the food being "organic".
But some "organic" farms also have practices that can lead to prettier or tastier food.
Organic is a marketing term.
By definition, a GMO seed cannot be grown using organic practices, since the seeds themselves are produced by "excluded methods", as defined in CFR section 205.2 : Excluded methods.
A variety of methods used to genetically modify organisms or influence their growth and development by means that are not possible under natural conditions or processes and are not considered compatible with organic production.
As Justin Ma notes, there are concessions to the practicality of the fact that GMO foods are present in the food stream and so really are really kept low rather than eliminated.
Organic is a marketing term with no useful definition.
But most techniques sold as organic are ill suited for large volumes, so I suspect that the country that becomes the world's food supplier will more likely use science based agriculture such as GMO.
Today's natural foods, of course, are much cleaner, but many are still sickened and occasionally killed by e.coli, listeria, and salmonella, largely on account of the manure fertilizer.
Undoubtedly, some farm *workers* have been injured or killed by pesticides, something that would be unlikely on an organic farm, because the pesticides they are allowed to use are less concentrated.
Organic farmers still use poisons, however.
If you wish to eat meat, organic pastured types (or those indicating that the animals were not given hormones) are the most recommended to avoid cause for concern in this regard.
No, not all food is organic, and a thoughtful and thorough answer will take longer than I have on my phone battery.
Organic farming requires natural solutions to these issues.
There are huge commercial farms that have lobbied for and diluted the original definitions proposed for organics, and produce large quantities of produce on a maginally better margin than their conventional crops because their process is not much differentiated.
I have a neighbor who sells 'hand raised' organic muscovy ducks to white cloth restaurants at twice the margin he gets at the farmer's market.
The main issue is that organic farming produces less food per unit of land than 'conventional' agriculture - sometimes by as much as 50%, but it depends.
So with a still-expanding global population and a finite (and, in some areas, disappearing) amount of available arable land, large-scale organic farming is not efficient enough to meet demand.
I found this Forbes article with a brief but fairly comprehensive round-up Why Organic is not 'Sustainable'
You are unlikely to find shops selling organic produce in UP (NOIDA is the only likely place).
Asking around at farms is the only other possibility, but then organic farming is yet to make inroads.
Apart from the organic food hopefully being produced according to a policy on which agricultural techniques are allowed in its production.
Which does not affect nutrition, usually, but might have an impact on ecology and residues of pesticides, antibiotica etc.. That said, many 'organic' certificates are not very strict, politely put.
There are grants given for organic production research and farmers who are organic in their methods can enroll in "government programs".
A farmer growing organic corn can sign up for programs that all corn growers can sign up for.
And, organic methods can be as good as non organic...and in certain situations will outperform non organic methods, depending on how run down the soil biome and soil structure is due to abuse.
Chipotle claims using "food with integrity" but does not claim that all their sources are organic or non GMO.
Non-organic or GMO foods can also be delivered with integrity as long as you are not lying about their source.
it is not like there is any nutritional difference between organic, non-organic, GMO and non-GMO foods.
Organic fruits and vegetables have the potential to be more nutritious than conventional produce, but the reality depends on the details.
See Why Organic Food May Not Be Heal their For You for a summary.
It has now been shown that organic dairy and meat has a different balance of fatty acids, one that has a higher proportion of omega-3s.
So if your organic fruit comes from a local farm, it probably is slightly more nutritious and almost certainly tastes better.
Careful studies have shown that the nutritional content of fruits and vegetables now is significantly poorer than 50 years ago, because of breeding: Changes in USDA food composition data.
If your "organic" produce is also "heirloom," you are eating more nutritious food.
(Note that a GMO food is in one instance -- Golden rice -- be more nutritious than the traditional variety.
)Overall, if you are very selective about what locally grown organic heirloom produce you buy, you could definitely get more "bang for your bite."
But if you are more concerned about "bang for your buck," a balanced diet of conventional foods is an easier way to stay healthy.
Shopping the perimeter of the store where you find whole foods -- produce, meats/seafood, grains, dairy -- is a good start.
If you want to avoid GMOs, shop for certified organic products or products that have gone through the non-GMO verified.
Verbatim from: <url> " HOW TO AVOID CONSUMING GMO'S WHEN EATING OUT: Unless labeled or listed organic (or from a reputable local farm the restaurant can verify does not use GMO seeds or feed), I suggest avoiding these 8 genetically modified (GM) foods when dining out: Corn Soy Sugar (beet sugar - i.e.
Ask your server about the oils they use to make your food - this is where GMOs are hidden in almost everything from salad dressings to soups to pan or deep fried items.
There is also no demonstrated food safety or nutritional difference between organic milk and conventional milk.
I think it is fair to say that cows in an organic system are treated more humanely.
If this matters to you, feel free to pay the price premium that organic milk provides.
Why is organic food produce more expensive than conventionally grown fruits, vegetables and grains?
I also wonder if organic food is overpriced or is all conventional supermarket foods underpriced.
Organic milk tends to be UHT pasteurized because it was shipped so far; there used to be relatively few organic dairies.
You can get UHT conventional milk (sometimes even on the shelves next to the dried and evaporated milk), but for the most part UHT and organic go hand in hand.
That makes a relatively small dent in the price of organic milk, which is already a premium.
But if I have dollar 50 for groceries and tomatoes are dollar 1.99 and the organic tomatoes are dollar 4.99, I am probably going to go and buy the normal tomatoes.
If a product is labeled organic then there are rigid standards to follow.
In simple terms organic refers to food that is grown without chemical fertilizers and pesticides which is theoretically better for your health since the body's immune system does not have to work so hard to remove these toxins ingested with the food; and also the soil condition is enhanced with natural composting methods which makes a heal their bio-system for microorganisms, insects and all creatures living downstream or upwind.
When you buy organic food you are paying for food clean from undesirable toxins and also paying the farmer to be a good caretaker of the land.
On the other hand, use of chemical fertilizers tends to deplete the soil over time and the use of pesticides kills even beneficial insects, micro-organisms in the soil, can negatively effect birds and often ends up in the streams and rivers, polluting the entire food chain.
So a consumer also pays for this scenario when buying non-organic products.
I know that they sell all these kind of fancy eggs like corn fed, free range, organic etc and the price changes with them.
There is very little difference between organic vs. conventional dairy production.
Organic cows must be on feed that was organically raised, and sick cows treated with anything that is not a conventional drug).
Of course we do not live in a perfect world, but for better or worse, GMOs are prohibited in "Organic Products".
"Organic" means different things to different people like uses of "Natural Fertilizers" or "Natural Pesticides" etc..., But, GMOs are banned: See the following' The use of genetic engineering, or genetically modified organisms (GMOs), is prohibited in organic products.
This means an organic farmer cannot plant GMO seeds, an organic cow cannot eat GMO alfalfa or corn, and an organic soup producer cannot use any GMO ingredients.
To meet the USDA organic regulations, farmers and processors must show they are not using GMOs and that they are protecting their products from contact with prohibited substances, such as GMOs, from farm to table.
Organic operations implement preventive practices based on site-specific risk factors, such as neighboring conventional farms or shared farm equipment or processing facilities.
For example, some farmers plant their seeds early or late to avoid organic and GMO crops flowering at the same time (which can cause cross-pollination).
Others harvest crops prior to flowering or sign cooperative agreements with neighboring farms to avoid planting GMO crops next to organic ones.
Farmers also designate the edges of their land as a buffer zone where the land is managed organically, but the crops are not sold as organic.
Roughly 4-5% of US food sales are organic according to the Organic Trade Association (OTA) and old data from the USDA (at Organic Market Overview).
Picking from the OTA's press release U.S. organic sales post new record of dollar 43.3 billion in 2015 For 2015 in the US: dollar 43.3 billion in sales "Nearly 5% of all food sold in the US was organic" "Almost 13 percent of the produce sold in this country is now organic." "Dairy accounts for 15 percent of total organic food sales." "produce and dairy account for more than half of total organic food sales," "non-food products account for just 8.2% of overall organic sales" "Growth in the non-food category was led by organic fiber, followed closely by organic supplements." Organic consumption varies by location.
I am unable to open your first link about pesticides used on organic crops.
Country of origin is very important in choosing organic food, partly because of how strictly standards are followed, but also because of the quality of the water supply used to grow the food.
Organic food from China is not worth eating - their water is heavily polluted.
My understanding is that the pesticides that are actually commonly used in organic farming in the USA are far less toxic than many of the synthetic pesticides.
There is no question that regular consumption of conventional produce leaves pesticide residues in the blood, which can be eliminated by switching to an organic diet.
Can you show any evidence that an organic diet results in significant pesticide residues in the human body?
I do not eat organic food but I always choose free range eggs.
it is never been proven that organic produce is more nutrient dense, so the answer is probably no, but without question eating organic food has benefits.
Organic foods are not subjected to the potentially harmful pesticides or drugs that non organic foods generally are.
For example, non organic fruits and vegetables are normally sprayed with chemical pesticides to reduce crop spoilage and non organic animals are routinely fed antibiotics and growth hormones to make them ready for slaughter in an unnaturally short time frame.
Organic foods follow a stringent protocol to be deemed organic, without a chemical in sight!
These chemical pesticides and drugs are of course deemed safe to inevitably end up in our diets, but many people, myself included, question this 'safety', and prefer food to be more natural and to be chemical and drug free.
it is personal choice, but I would say that if you were weighing up your decision on going organic, then do not base it on nutrient density alone.
The feed needs to be produced according to the standards for organic farming, as well, and be primarily grown locally.
Specific organic farming co-ops/labelling systems usually follow stricter criteria, the above is pretty much the minimum for eggs to be labelled as organic.
Organic pesticides/herbicides can be just as dangerous as conventional ones. or just as harmless, or even completely identical.
Despite decades of testing, no evidence exists that any of these categories is more likely to cause cancer, allergies, autism, food poisoning, death, or anything else.
The definitions of "organic," "conventional," and "GMO" has and will continue to change over time and national borders, among other factors.
A chemist will say anything is organic.
Glyphosate is also sprayed on a lot of non-GMO crop plantings, either before or after the growing of the crops, so there is a lot in things like millet, for instance, and it is also present in meat and especially edible organs -- so if you are going to cook liver, for instance, you absolutely, definitely want to get an organically raised animal's organs.
Anyway, the best advice is to buy organically certified foods if you can, especially when it comes to anything that is soy or corn based.
Anything that is not organically certified and contains soy or corn is 99% certain to be GMO and to contain glyphosate.
I eat local eggs, some locally raised meat, good quality butter, olive oil, lots of fresh vegetables, and some processed foods (organic or made from organic ingredients).
My answer to the question regarding the current trend towards eating organic, GMO-free food was merely that one has to be cautious with respect to the safety data on GMO crops when consumed by humans.
I have decided that I will live with organic food as the lesser evil.
I often travel in the US and always buy organic foods there.
I also recently traveled to Europe and bought organic food as much as I could.
On glyphosates in food: Monsanto seems to think that it is safe for human consumption.
Organic food may not be the best, but it is all we have left under the USDA.
But there are environmental benefits to "organic".
But organic is definitely better for wildlife, that is worth paying extra for ( in my opinion ).
Organic produce contains fewer pesticides.
Organic food is often fresher.
Organically raised animals are NOT given antibiotics, growth hormones, or fed animal byproducts.
Organic meat and milk are richer in certain nutrients.
Organic food is GMO-free.
You can get organic food products in delhi from cowboys, Cowboys are one of the Best Organic Food Products company in Delhi, Suppliers of organics food products such as Cow Ghee, Cow Milk, Pure Honey, Organics dairy products.
Some studies have shown higher levels of antioxidants in organic foods and that more animals and people prefer the taste.
Furthermore one of the stipulations of a food being organic in the United States was that an organic food could have been genetically modified in a lab so it is in it is most natural state.
When it comes to meats etc you can also feel a little more at ease with your conscience because organic livestock are required to have more access to the outdoors.
Organic is not always better.
He knows the eggs that are "organic" and "cage-free" are actually coming from hens who have no hen house so half are pecked to death by boss hens (a terrible death) but the humans are not allowed to stop the abusive pecking deaths because they are required to make the living conditions for the hens exactly what it would be like in the wild.
Same thing with organic.
It depends, if they are Organic on principal because they want their land and their animals to be as healthy and clean as possable, and they want to spread the Organic message.
There is no getting away from the fact that Organic means more time, and less productivity, all that costs money.
If a busness is using the word Organic cynically, without staying true to the principals of Organic farming, then they are probably making a bucketload.
For example almost all honey's can be labelled organic.
So I would not pay any extra for organic honey.
But I would pay extra for an organic chicken.
Organic farming may be a methodology of crop and placental mammal production that involves far more than selecting to not use pesticides, fertilizers, genetically changed organisms, antibiotics and growth hormones.
Organic production may be a holistic system designed to optimize the productivity and fitness of numerous communities inside the agro-ecosystem, together with soil organisms, plants, placental mammal and other people.
The principal goal of organic production is to develop enterprises that ar property and harmonious with the setting.
The general principles of organic production, from the Canadian Organic Standards (2006), embrace the following: defend the setting, minimize soil degradation and erosion, decrease pollution, optimize biological productivity and promote a sound state of health maintain semipermanent soil fertility by optimizing conditions for biological activity inside the soil maintain biological diversity inside the system recycle materials and resources to the best extent attainable inside the enterprise give attentive care that promotes the health and meets the behavioral desires of placental mammal prepare organic product, action careful process, and handling ways so as to keep up the organic integrity and important qualities of the product in the least stages of production think about renewable resources in regionally organized agricultural systems Organic farming promotes the utilization of crop rotations and canopy crops, and encourages balanced host/predator relationships.
Organic residues and nutrients created on the farm ar recycled back to the soil.
Cover crops and composted manure are accustomed maintain soil organic matter and fertility.
Integrated pest and weed management, and soil conservation systems are valuable tools on an organic farm.
Organically approved pesticides include "natural" or other pest management products included in the Permitted Substances List (PSL) of the organic standards.
The Permitted Substances List identifies substances permitted for use as a pesticides in organic agriculture.
All grains, forages and protein supplements fed to livestock must be organically grown.
The organic standards generally prohibit products of genetic engineering and animal cloning, synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, sewage sludge, synthetic drugs, synthetic food processing aids and ingredients, and ionizing radiation.
Prohibited products and practices must not be used on certified organic farms for at least three years prior to harvest of the certified organic products.
Livestock must be raised organically and fed 100 per cent organic feed ingredients.
Organic farming presents many challenges.
Some crops are more challenging than others to grow organically; however, nearly every commodity can be produced organically.
Growth of Organic Agriculture The world market for organic food has grown for over 15 years.
The retail organic food market in Canada is estimated at over dollar 1.5 billion in 2008 and dollar 22.9 billion in the U.S.A. in 2008.
It is estimated that imported products make up over 70 per cent of the organic food consumed in Canada.
Canada also exports many organic products, particularly soybeans and grains.
The Canadian Organic Farmers reported 669 certified organic farms in Ontario in 2007 with over 100,000 certified organic acres of crops and pasture land.
About 48 per cent of the organic cropland is seeded to grains, 40 per cent produces hay and pasture and about five per cent for certified organic fruits and vegetables.
Why Farm Organically?
The main reasons farmers state for wanting to farm organically are their concerns for the environment and about working with agricultural chemicals in conventional farming systems.
Organic farmers find their method of farming to be profitable and personally rewarding.
Why Buy Organic?
Consumers purchase organic foods for many different reasons.
Many want to buy food products that are free of chemical pesticides or grown without conventional fertilizers.
Product taste, concerns for the environment and the desire to avoid foods from genetically engineered organisms are among the many other reasons some consumers prefer to buy organic food products.
In 2007 it was estimated that over 60 per cent of consumers bought some organic products.
Approximately five per cent of consumers are considered to be core organic consumers who buy up to 50 per cent of all organic food.
Err, I would go with organic.
Not if you live in the US though "Organic" is meaningless in the US.
There is zero difference in taste or health from organic food but "real" organic food is substantially better for wildlife that live in the fields where your vegetables are grown.
Anyway I like field mice more than my friend so I am going for organic.
Every field needs fertilizer organic or synthetic and or micro nutrients.
While were on it I would also argue organic animal husbandry equal cruelty.
Heck noboby believes in "organic" medicine for humans do they?
What is organic farming?
Lets define exactly what "organic farming" means.
It really boils down to what "organic" methods are being used to produce food, fiber, energy.
Definition #1"Organic meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones.
Organic food is produced without using most conventional pesticides; fertilizers made with synthetic ingredients or sewage sludge; bioengineering; or ionizing radiation.
Before a product can be labeled 'organic,' a Government-approved certifier inspects the farm where the food is grown to make sure the farmer is following all the rules necessary to meet USDA organic standards.
Companies that handle or process organic food before it gets to your local supermarket or restaurant must be certified, too." Consumer Brochure, USDA National Organic Program.
(Or in the case of animal husbandry, organic non-GMO corn and soy is substituted for conventionally raised corn and soy and no antibiotics/hormones used.)
This is the lowest quality version of organic and while you do have fewer pesticide residues and fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens, the nutritional quality is usually very close to the same.
On the other hand this version of organic really was invented to meet certain regulatory guidelines and many organic growers do not even consider it "organic" at all.
Just a cheap imitation of organic designed to command a higher price at market and meet that consumer demand.
I personally call this "substitution organic", and its main benefit is that a farmer can convert to this easily without much in the way of new training or equipment.
Others have termed this Organic 101, or phase 1 organic, the bare minimum basics.
Definition #2 "Organic agriculture is an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles and soil biological activity.
It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain and enhance ecological harmony." USDA National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) definition, April 1995 This definition more closely resembles what organic meant prior to the government and the certification boards taking control.
And much faster than "substitution organic".
Others have called this Organic 201 or phase 2 Organic.
It is what most people think of when they use the term "organic" as it applies to food, even if what they really are getting is definition #1 above.
This organic usually sustainable , but not always, mainly due to externalities.
You might find "Organic", "Beyond Organic", "Biointensive", "EcoOrganic", "EcoAg", "Permaculture" etc or any number of other newly invented terms all falling under the broader umbrella of "Organic".
This type of organic is often on the cutting edge and is heavily reliant on systems science, holism and biomimicry.
So some farmers practising this, most notably Joel Salatin and Gabe Brown, do not even call themselves "organic".
In almost all cases this type of organic is hugely more nutritious than conventional.
This is Organic 301 or phase 3 organic.
This is basically the general goal of organic though, no matter what name or definition is used.
Spencer's is one of those very few reliable online grocery store offering good organic food online.
The store offers wide range of daily need products like fresh fruits and vegetables online, non-veg items, household items and organic food items like organic staples.
THE INITIATIVE Terragreens are an organic food producing company based in Hyderabad that believes in the concept of natural food, or simply - as nature intended.
Bonterra Vineyards makes wines organically, and offers quality wines from many varietals at moderate prices.
Many French wines from Burgundy are made according to biodynamique methods, which goes way beyond organic standards.
In Chicago, I mostly go to Mariano's and Whole Foods Market.
When I am in New Zealand, I go to Commonsense Organics in Wellington.
Most supermarkets these days carry some organic foods, but if you want more than milk or a couple of smaller items, it helps to go somewhere that specializes.
We used to get deliveries from an organic co-op in Wellington.
Sometimes organic produce sits on the shelves in supermarkets for a long time.
Many Organic Stores offers 24Mantra, which is a leading brand in India.
However, many new brands are offering quality organic products.
You can also find list of organic stores in India in OrganicRooster.com
It is very tough to say they are 100% organic.
To the some extent you can trust the organic certification.
There is no way to find out that vegetable vendors who claim that the vegetable are grown under organic conditions.
For Organic Farming info Read : HERE.
Emphasis on organic and non-processed foods.
I do not consider Whole Foods to be a natural food store (although this is subjective since there are currently no guidelines for what is/ is not considered 'natural'), but they definitely carry the most natural choices available for a given product.
When it comes to Organic there arises "Certification by competent authorities."
The Questions raised by Organic Farming Community on GMO seeds/plants are yet to be answered by proponents of GMO's Standards for organic agriculture were set recently.
Why should there be a regulation on organic farming is a question asked but never answered.
There are various websites for buying organic food online.
- BBC News Monsanto Campaign Tries to Gain Support for Gene-Altered Food Bayer AG: Corporate Crimes Monsanto's Cruel, and Dangerous, Monopolization on American Farming Bayer and Monsanto to merge in mega-deal that could reshape world's food supply _____ The effects of organic agriculture on biodiversity and abundance: a meta-analysis Marketing huh.
You could just as easily say that organic farming methods are "normal" and the use of pesticides is not.
Well organic food is more expensive because the U.S. government is in bed with Monsanto and other BigAgra companies that then receive government tax dollar subsidies (huge amounts) to grow corn for High Fructose Corn Syrup, Grain, and the ingredients used in food preservation.
People get on a high horse about the poorest of Americans using food stamps when in reality the amount of our tax dollars being given away to BigAgra companies like Monsanto is astronomical.
I would add to that by saying that the food and processing industry, actually, has an even bigger say in these traits.
On organic/non-organic: You are aware that both systems of food production (at least in the United States) use chemicals, derived from raw sources or synthesised.
There is also the notion that food without "chemicals" is pure, when there are vegetables that can kill or harm people that have been bred conventionally.
* The claim that "GMO foods may transmit viral particles which can cause autoimmune disease and fertility issues" needs to be backed up.
Which ironically, is the same pesticide used in organic produce.
Typically, the yield is less for organic crops.
Organic crops can only utilize natural IPPM methods and natural fertilizers.
The cost difference between the two farming practices may very, but the yield for organic farms never matches traditional farming.
Organic foods may cost less to produce, but that is not a significant reason for the higher price.
With organic crops, the ability to predict the yield reduces, and the final yield itself is dramatically reduced, if it were the same price, he would make much less profit from organic crops.
If people demand organic foods, the farmer needs an incentive to grow organic.
Organic crops will yield at least 30%-50% less than the same crop that is treated with chemicals.
Since there are people who demand organic food, the farmer can justify doubling the cost of an organic crop.
What the farmer risks is chemical residue from other fields contaminating his organic crop.
If that happens, it can no longer be considered organic and he loses the price increase without gaining the benefits of the chemicals.
Organic farmers have a pretty stressful job, and they should be compensated for that.
If people are willing to spend more for organic, a farmer will take the risk involved as long as there is an increased profit that goes with it.
(I use the quotes because it a silly term) it is expensive and no more nutritious than conventionally grown foods, though it does contain much lower levels of pesticide and herbicides, which I suspect one does not want to ingest a lot of.
If, however, you have the wealth to shop for everything in the organic market, I see nothing wrong with that.
I think organic food is more expensive per unit to produce because the pesticides and herbicides used in modern farming (along with the mechanization) allow for more units to be produced per allotted space.
So an acre of land farmed using modern practices may result in a greater bounty than an acre of land farmed organically.
Another aspect is there is some degree of over pricing because people perceive greater value in organic food, and they are willing to pay for it.
As owner of a business selling natural and organic products, I know I have competitors pricing products much higher than their costs of production.
There is no way to grow foods entirely without pesticides.
"Organic" pesticides try to take advantage of the "natural" pesticides.
that is actual organic farming: the term was coined for the organic farmer , who is not a machine.
The rest of "organic", as a USDA certified label, is the bad reasons.
They involve adapting the original organic idea and trying to scale it up.
"Organic" farming does indeed use pesticides, and they are every bit as toxic as the artificial pesticides.
And most of what you read on the topic of organic farming, both for and against, is very bad.
Here's the deal: organic food is not lower in "toxins".
Organic farming is slightly better for the land and the farmers than the even worse offenders in industrial processing, if only because the higher margins slightly reduce the incentives to commit environmental and labor atrocities.
It does not matter if that TV dinner is "organic" or not because it is been so highly processed to cram it full of extra tasty calories, fats, sugars, etc.
Industrial food is the best way to feed a planet of seven billion people.
The industrial versions of organic are slightly less destructive.
After that, the difference between "organic" and regular industrial conventional is minor.
While many people believe that food grown organically is better for you, they may not be able to tell you exactly why it is better for you.
The absence of pesticide residues on fruits and vegetables is a fairly obvious benefit but there are more other far-reaching advantages of going organic.
This raises a question "WHY ORGANICS ARE BETTER"(1) The big-picture benefits have been discovered and documented by the Rodale Institute with an in-depth, long-term study.
The Farming Systems Trial:registered: The Rodale Institute in Pennsylvania, USA, has been doing research on organic growing practices for over 60 years.
A little over 30 years ago, they decided to do an in-depth comparison study to determine just how beneficial organic farming really is.
The organic manure-based and legume-based system yields were equal to the conventional system under normal growing conditions.
During periods of moderate drought, the organic system yields surpassed the conventional system.
Environmental Impact The environmental impact of the organic systems was far less than that of the conventional system.
Soil in the areas that were farmed organically was improved overall by the nitrogen-fixing legumes or "green manure" and animal manure.
Economic Impact The positive economic impacts of organic farming practices were made clear with the Farming Systems Trial:registered:.
Manual labor used in organic farming increases employment opportunities, producing 30% more jobs with each hectare of land farmed.
Profits from organically grown crops were either the same as or greater than those from crops grown with conventional methods.

Organic farming techniques, as now practiced, produce on average half as much per acre as conventional crops.
At the moment, we can produce just a bit more food than is necessary to feed the current population (using the current mix of organic and conventional farming), but we cannot distribute it effectively to that population, so people starve.
Not just because of lower yields and lack of access to synthetic inputs but the organic movement's agitation to keep farmers from accessing the latest technology and science.
The subsistence farmers in Africa using traditional methods are essentially organic farmers and it is with joy that the organic movement keeps them using these methods, keeping them in perpetual poverty.
The organic movement is also fighting to keep solutions like Golden Rice from poor farmers, making it guilty of millions of blind and dead.
USDA-FDA.com Nutritional Labeling, USDA Label Expeditor, Facility Consultant, UPC Barcodes The USDA defines certain criteria for food sold in the US with the label "Organic".
However, the USDA makes no claims, and in fact states that there is no evidence, to whether or not organic food is heal their , safer, or more nutritious.
From first hand experience, I can tell you that organic vegetables are more likely to have pest damage.
The first time I bought organic, I bought a zucchini, and sliced it in half right through a worm that had apparently been living inside it.
People have a common perception that organic vegetables are larger and heal their , but this is due to selection bias.
Grocery stores that sell a lot of organic vegetables tend to be more expensive and have tighter selection criteria.
I regularly attend one of the largest farmer-only farmer's markets in the US, and the organic crops are typically pitiful compared to the commercially fertilized ones.
There have also been some high profile news cases lately where "organic" farms turned out to be getting a lot of runoff from traditional commercial farms.
Until just a couple of years ago, there was no regulation at all and anyone could call their produce organic.
Local and Organic foods typically give you more nutrition for the buck...but be sensible.
it is better to choose a locally grown green vegetable at the farmers market from a farmer who does not have an organic certification than to get a vegetable flown in from the other side of the world with the organic label.
When eating whole, seasonal and local foods, it is of course better to choose gluten-free IF you are battling or want to avoid health issues such as autoimmunity.
Organic farming largely refers to growing crops without use of inorganic chemical pesticides or even inorganic nutrients.
Organic farming for entire mankind appears to me to be unviable.
So organic farming is meant to feed those elite among humans, who would like to escape the genetic impacts of nature devastation triggered by human interventions.
May be over a few thousand years, such populations who could continuously afford and consume such organic foods may out survive rest of human race, alternatively humans might adopt genetically to all evil impacts of adversities.
Food miles is not the only reason why organic is sometimes more environmentally destructive.
Other reasons can include lower efficiency (which means more acres of land used for production), and organic pesticides (which are sometimes worse than the non-organic equivalents).
I would like to look at it positively as I have the following facts to substantiate the same.I belong to Chennai and we are seeing a big number of organic stores sprouting up in the city.
There are more than 350 new organic stores covering every nook and corner of the city.
We have also seen web portals exclusive for organic products entering the market with heavy investments.
All these are clear indications that the Organic Industry is making solid gains in the market.
The common man has become much more aware that his daly food is highly polluted while being grown and contaminated while being stored.
More and more people has started searching for organic and natural alternatives.
Organic gardening in terraces has now become a trend not only among housewives, but also are being tried by professionals from the corporate sector.
The commitment of State as well as Central Governments has been so promising that lot of conventional farmers are now stepping into organic farming practices.
"National Project on Organic Farming (NPOF) is a continuing central sector scheme since 10th Five Year Plan.
The scheme is continuing in the 12th Plan.NPOF is being implemented by National Centre of Organic Farming at Ghaziabad and its six Regional Centres at Bangalore, Bhubaneshwar, Panchkula, Imphal, Jabalpur and Nagpur.
Besides working for realisation of targets under NPOF, NCOF and RCOFs are also performing specific roles in promotion of organic farming.
"Ref: National Centre of Organic Farming New packages released by different governments promise subsidies or agri loans with very minimal interest rates to support organic farming.
For the first time India's organic farmers are getting introduced to fair trade practices and their profits has increased by 20% to 40%.
Also new innovations in better and more effective organic fertilisers and pesticides has replaced the costly chemical based counterparts and increased the yield by more than 30% to 125%.
India's farming lands, once poisoned by heavy usage of pesticides is getting repaired and returned through natural and organic farming methods.
Private Participation is gaining pace in tying up with farmer and farmer producer companies in helping them with the right organic farming practices and promising the farmers a fair price for all their products.
Government of Tamilnadu has now come up with distribution of organic grow bags andorganic pesticides at a very reasonable rate.
Day by day the awareness towards the need of going organic is increasing which has resulted in more and more farmers joining the organic farming revolution.
From my earlier post Raj Kiran's answer to Do you think that organic farming will create a dominance in the world in the coming years?
However, a number of studies found that organic meats had less antibiotic resistance, which has environmental implications because greater resistance to antibiotics could lead to more dangerous "super-bugs".
At the same time, the research shows that organics tend to have more contaminants, such as e-coli.
In my views organic farming having great demand in India.
Organic farming having to great advantages as the crops is harvested is very healthy for the human health.
It increase the soil fertility as the soil amendments are use for cultivating organic crop.
No use of any chemical increase the market value of the particular crop So it shows that in future its is necessary do organic for soil and human health point of view.
Organic farming having not that much potential to feed upcoming population in future.
For one thing, the quality of the water used in farming is not regulated under organic certification.
I would definitely recommend organic milk over any super market milk.
Organic certification is a very stringent process that ensures not only the product but also the farmland is free of prohibited synthetic chemicals, gmo etc.
Yes organic farming is more sustainable than regular farming methods.
Organic farming is a safer and heal their practice because it makes use of the wastes from farms and gardens to fertilize the soil, instead of using the artificial fertilizers which contain harmful chemicals, pesticides, insecticides, etc.
Organic farming methods do not involve intensive farming practices like single cropping which is practiced in regular farming.
The pesticides used in organic method of farming is less toxic, is more natural containing nutrients, microbes, etc.
Consider that there are myriad varieties of natural pest control measures used by organic-certified farms including oil-based suffocants, which - granted - are a fair bit more expensive than conventional pesticides, but work equally well.
Especially in the U.S. tomatoes (among other foods) are being irradiated, with the 'intention' of reducing food poisoning and rendering larvae and eggs inert.
Remember, you are paying a premium for organic food because of the absence of synthetic fertilisers, chemical sprays, insecticides and pesticides, among other measures.
Nevertheless, organic foods are generally still sprayed for the sake of crop preservation, with substances on an 'permitted' list.
I think everyone agrees that chemical fertilizers/pesticides are not a desirable food group.
But a non-organic apple in your diet is better than no apple.
The real argument for eating organic food is that it is an alternative to a food system that is unsustainable and damaging to ecosystems, farm workers, fresh water, and pretty much all of the resources we require to survive.
A lot has been made about people eating organic to be healthy but there are a lot of ways to be healthy.
There is only one way to grow food that is not completely disrespectful to the land and it is through organic practices.
All things considered I would argue that Local food is probably the most healthy choice, in both nutrient content and overall footprint.
For example, a conventionally grown tomato from a farmstand down the road not only has a higher nutrient content than an organic one picked unripe in california or florida, but it also did not get packaged and ride in a truck for 2,000 miles to get to your sandwich.
I own and run a small diversified vegetable farm using only organic methods.
Organic certification has largely been co-opted by corporations as a marketing label.
As such anything labeled as organic in the grocery store is more expensive than it should be.
This means buy direct from us allows you to buy organic without the extra costs associated with certification or the drive to inflate corporate profits.
I do not buy into the whole ecofriendly organic garbage, but I really like their pizza.
there is a unique quality to some of their food.
We have clear standards which require certification, something that gives specific meaning to the word organic.
Some Americans are willing to pay a premium for organic and it remains to be seen whether that same market will develop in other countries.
In quite a bit of the world food scarcity and hunger are still focal points and a significant part of the world is interested in GMO crops/food.
One of the major pushes of global trade is crop stability in transit but one of the major pushes in organic is fresh and local.
So where it is easy to have a ship full of corn moving to markets, it would seem to me that organic fruit and vegetables are more vulnerable to damage in transit.
In those cases, aim not for organic but naturally raised.
By the same argument, you might also consider organic for oils.
Because organic crops have more pests and lower levels of nutrition than non-organic crops, the yield per acre is much lower.
Organic growers feed the soil which in turn feeds the plants (through the wondrous and complex activity of microbial soil life).
Organic farming aims to strengthen the plants.
Another organic method is to introduce companion planting.
Thus, the whole food chain is affected by pesticides - there are less birds and bees on non-organic farms.
But the most common definition is this: "Organic agriculture is an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles and soil biological activity.
It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain and enhance ecological harmony." USDA National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) definition, April 1995 This can effect the quality, cost of the food and/or the impact on the environment depending on the methods used.
For more information on that look here: Scott Strough's answer to Is organic food more nutritious?

Scott Strough's answer to Is organic food better for the environment?
Organic food was earlier found only in certain food stores but is now made available in all the supermarkets.
So, if you have that dilemma whether to go for organic or inorganic foods, understanding the facts on organic foods can help you with a right shopping from the next time.
Healthy Organic Food The "organic" is based on the method employed in producing these vegetables, grains, fruits, dairy products and meat.
The main idea behind producing organic foods was to protect the soil and conserve water while reducing pollution.
The overall pesticide levels in the organic foods is nearly 10 to 100 times lower than the conventionally produced food.
The pesticide residues in the organic foods is 3 to 4 times less likely than in the regular foods.
The toxic metals such as cadmium in the organic foods are also relatively low compared to the regular foods.
Organic foods such as chicken and pork are less likely to harbor the resistant bacteria and are especially good for children who have lower immune levels.
Organic foods also regulate the use of food additives and processing aids such as artificial sweeteners, flavors, and coloring agents.
Nutrient Value It is not certain whether organic foods are more nutritious over the inorganic foods.
Antioxidant content is nearly 60% higher in the organic fruits, vegetables and grains over the inorganic counterparts.
Flavonones which can reduce your risk for stroke are found to be 69% higher in the organic foods over the conventional foods.
Organic foods are generally sold to the nearby markets from the place of their harvest and that gives them their extra freshness over the conventional foods.
Overall, the nutrient values of organic food are a little higher than inorganic foods.
Worth Investing More on Organic Foods The main concern about the organic foods is their cost due to the expensive farming technique.
But if you like the idea of low pesticide and the environment-friendly production of organic foods then do not hold on to having the inorganic foods just to save few pennies.
If it is not possible for you to go for 100% organic food, at least replace those inorganic foods which have higher pesticide levels.
Organic food is better for the environment, soil and body.
More and more shoppers are convinced to buy organic food, and their market is steadily increasing.
Pick those products labeled as "organic" and certified by the USDA (US Department of Agriculture), when you shop through the food lanes this time.
If this seal is not present, then the product is not 100% organic, and might contain very few organic ingredients.
(As a matter of fact, I buy a mix of organic and conventional produce, based on what I can afford and which products have been shown to have the most pesticide residues.)
Now, most products that are labelled organic are just that - labelled organic.
Anyone can look up the regulations around organic certification, which as you have pointed out, clearly allow for some natural pesticides and a small number of carefully studied and deemed safe synthetic pesticides.
I do not often buy organic foods for a few reasons: The jury's still out on the health benefits of organic food.
Or the harmful effects of non-organic foods that have been washed properly, for that matter.
Nutritionally, they are comparable, and most non-organic chemicals used on produce can be washed off.
Here in the U.S. much of our organic produce is shipped to us from other parts of the world, offsetting much of the benefit of reducing chemical run off.
If given the choice between local or organic, I will almost always choose local.
"Organic" does not necessarily mean fewer pollutants.
And using animal products like manure as fertilizer also carries the risk of disease transmission, so organic produce should still be scrubbed thoroughly before eating it.
That being said, there is one type of food I consistently buy organic: milk.
I buy organic milk because of the widespread use of antibiotics in dairy cows and the increasing threat of antibiotic-resistant microbes in our environment.
But this is a choice I based more on my desire to reduce unnecessary antimicrobial treatment in general rather than any health benefits associated with organic milk.
For more information, see : Organic Food Has No Benefits Over Conventional Food, Says Study Are Organic Foods Safer or Heal their Than Conventional Alternatives?
: A Systematic Review Nutritional quality of organic foods: a syste... (Am J Clin Nutr.
Essentially it means they are using carbon-based chemicals but she had an interesting take on it that came to the same conclusion saying that it definitely does not mean that things labelled organic are better and could even be worse in some ways.
So if the water used to irrigate the crops is highly contaminated industrial wastewater full of pollutants and heavy metals, you can still claim the product is organic.
If you are seeing organic products from India, I would also be inclined to be sceptical.
by buying locally-grown organic, which is not hard to find around here.
It is produced according to organic farming principles which are committed to working in harmony with nature rather than against nature.
Organic farming works within the natural confines of the farming eco-system to provide you with great tasting food!
In practice organic farming; Avoids the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides Requires the highest standards of animal welfare Does not permit the use of genetically modified organisms Uses less fossil fuel energy per calorie of food produced Protects our biodiversity by maintaining suitable habitats for plants, animals and wildlife Encourages people to buy their food locally and in season Source : What is organic food ?
I always eat whatever i could afford and supermarket organic is not it anytime soon.
Specific requirements must be met and maintained in order for products to be labeled as "organic."
Organic crops must be grown in safe soil, have no modifications, and must remain separate from conventional products.
Organic livestock must have access to the outdoors and be given organic feed.
Wow sounds healthy but practically is expensive for middle class you can compare the price of organic food products.
I do not care, per se, if it is organic or if it is local but it often ends up being so.
Sometimes organic producers offer superior or unusual varieties, so I buy their stuff.
Restaurants and food manufacturers should be required to have safe ingredients and that is all.
No special distinction need be made for the source unless they willingly choose to market that in the growing and profitable Organic Food craze.
Plenty of natural food sources have dangerous enzymes, acids and chemicals which can be deadly or harmful if not used properly or if not used in moderation.
Plenty of natural and organic foods we eat every day have potentially harmful ingredients in varying quantities.
Plenty of certified organic ingredients can be harmful in large and small doses.
Plenty of certified organic pesticides will kill a human as easily as kill a bug.
All food ingredients should be tested and fully researched and in America and Europe we have some of the best standards in the world for testing food additives, ingredients and drugs.
As I pointed out in my answer, there are pesticides allowed on organic crops that are known (rather than probable) carcinogens.
Are you going to eliminate organic crops from your diet because of their pesticide residues?
Based on available science, that actually seems like the safest way to go, and I try to avoid organic produce when shopping.
The main reason most people initially begin going organic in their diets is because of health reasons.
The production of organic food actually reduces the risks of health problems to the general public.
Since organic farms avoid using these chemicals to treat their food, it is much safer overall than regular farming.
Organic foods also do not use antibiotics in animal food which can cause people to become more resistant to fighting disease over time.
Additionally, organic farms are much safer for their employees to work at since they are not exposed from all of these dangerous pesticides and chemicals.
Overall, organic farming is so much safer for everyone involved, it simply cannot be disputed.
Organic is purely a marketing term.
It has absolutely nothing to do with the safety or nutrition of food(1).
Any reputable peanut butter in a reasonably regulated food chain will be safe from aflatoxin.
Organic is, to be clear, no guarantee that those levels will be safe.
Footnotes (1) Boycott the butterfly, and stop buying organic.
Organics will usually contain essential oils like tea tree, orange, clove leaf etc.
Diatomaceous earth is an organic powder.
People usually think of "organic" as no pesticides or chemical fertilizerrs, but it just has to adhere to a list by Federal regulations.
you would be surprised at what qualifies as "organic" to the government.
I was production manager at a agricultural chemical manufacturer in arizona for 5 years where we produced organic certified and toxic products.
So-called "organic food", OTOH, can be not only unhealthy, but dangerous.
For instance, if you are allergic to shellfish, so you stay on an organic vegetarian diet, you will probably kill yourself.
what is the "organic" fertilizer used in much "organic" farming?
Besides, if it is food, it is organic.
You eat things that are, or once were, alive - and that is what "organic" means.
(Except that if they are getting it from "organic" shrimp, peanut shells or something else you are allergic to, it could kill you.)
Eat "organic", "non-GMO" food full of cholesterol that uses salt to enhance the flavor (both salt and cholesterol are part of an "organic" diet, by the way ) and you are eating unhealthy food.
Organic foods are defined as those that have been grown without using fertilizers or pesticides.
Most organic farms, in fact must implement strict guidelines to receive their organic certification.
These guidelines are so strict that, for example; farmers may not use any chemically treated wooden stakes when planting; they must keep all machinery free from dust and foreign substances which could contaminate the crops; and must use animal feed that is purely organic in quality.
Getting organic certification requires food production that can be certified.
Certification requires that growing, storing, processing, packaging, and shipping which include total elimination of such things as chemicals, pesticides; antibiotics; food additives; and such.
Also, the farmland has to be free of chemicals for three years; the farmer must keep detailed records; must maintain physical separation of organic products from non-organic products; must have periodic inspections; and are subject to the same agricultural, and safety regulations which govern non-organic farmers.
it is not necessary to buy all organic fruits and vegetables if cost is an issue.
Here is a list of the Clean 15, ie, fruits and vegetables that bear little to no pesticides: onions avocados sweet corn pineapples mango sweet peas asparagus kiwi fruit cabbage eggplant cantaloupe watermelon grapefruit sweet potatoes sweet onions Then there are the Dirty Dozen, the fruits and vegetables that, if at all possible, should be purchased organic.
They are: celery peaches strawberries apples domestic blueberries nectarines sweet bell peppers spinach, kale and collard greens cherries potatoes imported grapes lettuce If you purchase the Dirty Dozen non-organic, make sure that you wash them really well before eating.
Eating organic supposedly reduces pollution since potentially harmful chemicals, such as non-organic fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides, do not end up washing into streams and rivers.
If you really want to be ethical with your food, the safest way is to grow your food organically in your back yard.
laver and other types of edible seaweed- or take an organic supplement that has the iodine.
If it is produced safely, can be applied safely, and will not get into the food stuffs beyond a tolerable level, then it is a candidate for organics.
To me, mild to moderate hypothyroidsm may be taken up for natural or the so called organic cure.
Take care while depending on organic/natural remedies.
As others have said, there are specific programs for organic farmers and there are also programs for farmers markets and various consumer-facing pieces and the largest financial support from the USDA go to hunger relief efforts rather than to farms.
Recently a friend who grows organic commodities was telling me about some of the various government programs that have assisted her.
From the Scientific American Why does organic milk last so much longer than regular milk?
I gather that organic means the farmer does not expose the herd to routine unnecessary antibiotic use, so valuable in avoiding the cow's enteral bacteria developing antibiotic resistance we all so fear.
Because of the longer transit times organic milk is heated to a higher temperature killing all bacteria.
As far as I am aware, science has not shown a great difference between organic and non-organic foods.
My personal experience with the two is that some food tastes better (tomatoes, chicken).
This anecdote really spoke out to me: It sounds all dandy, but one of the girls on that farm had to stop going to English classes because there was too much farm work to do , especially with an organic system.
In my view Organic farming may not sustain for too long.
with organic farming we cannot match the agriculture growth with that of population growth.
As such now it is not possible to check whether the produce has come from organic farming or not.
It is not easy to do organic farming because every thing should be organic.
In the present situation to fertilize organic farming you need only organic fertilisers like Fym, vermiculture etc.
If the area under organic farming increases it is very difficult to get those kind of fertilisers.
Organic pesticides are not that effective to control the epidemics.
production figures cannot sustain if the organic farming increases.
If more and more people opt for organic food Because of its value adulteration with normal food will increase.
Common man cannot afford to by organic, food.
At least, I do not have a strong preference for organic food.
There was a study done a few months ago and it found that basically, there is slightly more pesticide residue on conventional fruits and vegetables than on organic fruits and vegetables.
The only precaution I take, and I take it with all food, is to wash it thoroughly before consuming or cooking it.
While poisoning from pesticides is extremely unlikely, bacterial or parasitic contamination of our food supply is relatively common.
All it takes is one episode of food poisoning or one class in parasitology and anyone who thinks about it will be very shy of ordering raw oysters, sashimi, seared tuna, or a rare steak.
Nutrients are created by the plant's growth processes and metabolism -- whether the food is grown conventionally or organically does not really do much to change the plant's metabolic processes.
A great many peer-reviewed studies have failed to find any health benefit to organic foods over equivalent conventional foods.
The chemicals used in non-organic farming fall into two basic categories: Pesticides Fertilizers Pesticides are applied to the surface of the plant.
That goes for both conventional and organic fruit -- the organic stuff does not have as much sprayed on it, but it does have more exposure to illness-causing contaminants like e. coli.
Note that food wastage is much higher without these pesticides -- organic farming tends to require ~10% more farmland to produce the same final crop due to pest damage.
And ripe organic fruit spoils in days rather than weeks.
The coating of food-grade fungicide and/or wax on most conventionally-grown fruit does an enormous amount of good in terms of shelf life.
But organic crops are fertilized too -- they are just fertilized with stuff like manure and crop waste.
On one hand, this creates a much greater opportunity for transmission of food-borne illness.
(This risk seems to offset any possible health gains from organic food.)
This is why some organic produce tastes better than conventional produce.
Anyway, studies have shown that organic foods offer little/no health benefit over the same conventional produce.
There are a few cases where organic food probably is better: I personally think organic bananas taste a little better than regular bananas.
If you are making orange or lemon zest, you should use organic fruit to avoid the fungicides and fruit dyes used on citrus skins.
If you really hate wax on your apples, it is easier to buy organic apples than clean conventional ones.
it is not fruit, but organic milk lacks some antibiotics and hormones that have been linked to health effects in humans.
Sometimes, organic farmers just care more about the quality of their crops than conventional mass-market farmers.
But perhaps more often, grocery stores buy higher-quality organic produce than conventional produce because the organic stuff is significantly higher-margin and they want you to buy more of it.
In general , there is not much benefit to organic food.
'Organic farming' has a future in India, but it is not the future of agriculture in India.
As Rajeev Saxena also observes we got to have a reliable 'certification system' in place so that the consumers do not keep guessing about the quality of the products they shall pay as organic.
A.S Ramprasad has rightly pointed out that in 'organic farming' there is drastic decline in yields.
For the purpose of food security for the teeming millions we shall have to continue with the conventional agochemical-dependent intensive agriculture.
Even in this practices like 'integrated pest management' (that includes biocontrol agents) complementary use of organic manures etc shall help.
Prudent approach is that we do not always think in terms of 'absolute organic' or vice versa practice.
In case the champions of organic agriculture accept full blast use of genetically engineered crops to be in the 'organic domain' then a host of insecticides, fungicides, weedicides can be dispensed with and large-scale availability of non-toxic food may become a reality for all in the foreseeable future.
"Low Budget" and "Health Food Store" probably do not go together at all!
There is usually a huge mark-up on prices for anything labelled 'organic' or 'natural'.
Co-ops are where a group of people get together and buy their food in bulk, then distribute it, sharing costs - everyone gets it a bit cheaper.
City farms are just what they sound like - a farm, often in your city, where people have grown fruit and vegies and herbs, usually organic.
Often these city farms have a weekly market, but markets are everywhere nowadays and can have the freshest, best quality foods straight from the producers without the markup you see in supermarkets or commercial stores (of course, find a proper market, not a 'trendy' one).
Foods that are touted to be 'all natural' or 'organic' are not necessarily better or even good for you.
Go for foods as untouched by humans as possible and learn how to make the things you like to eat from scratch.
Organic food generally tastes better.
Non-organic macaroni and cheese does taste better.
Unfortunately, at this point most food labeled organic is done so primarily as a marketing strategy, as the trendiness of organic food has been largely co-opted by business interests and Big Ag.
Most organic food sold in large retail outlets is grown very similarly to the conventional alternatives, with negligible differences concerning the ecological or social impacts, and questionable health gains to the consumer (the Internet is full of studies both professing and denying the healthfulness of organic over conventional.
Full disclosure: I am an organic farmer, I know where I stand).
Organic food in the original sense of the term arose from a very real concern shared by many people for the quality and healthfulness of their food and the system of industrial agriculture that produces it.
Unfortunately, to most people it is framed in very simplistic terms: has this food been sprayed with some chemical(s) or not?
In a deeper sense of the term, the growing popularity of Organic food reflects the desire of many people to eat food that is grown responsibly and thoughtfully, that among other things might involve care for animals and their well being, care for the people that do the work, concern for what happens downstream of the farm, interest in building and maintaining dynamic and sustainable rural communities, and/or the desire to create systems of agriculture that can endure into the indefinite future (...since our current system of industrial agriculture cannot).
What this gets at is that the growing of organic food is not just concerned with the health or quality of a carrot or an egg but rather in the process strives to build health in bigger ways too: that of the soil, of the farmer, of farm animals, of wild animals, of the farmer's community, of the consumer that he relies on, of biodiversity in general (for the earth's own sake, if not the various ecological services it provides, such as pollinators and other sorts of beneficial insects), of all people.
Unfortunately, even most people who seek organics are primarily concerned with the quality of what food goes into their body and less so with those other, more abstract things.
So yes, organic as it stands is mostly just a marketing gimmick.
Although I appreciate the movements toward better food choices, like organic and locally sourced, we also have more unlabeled GMO foods (refined oils, soy, corn, tomatoes, etc., and ever more junk and processed foods around.

So you are asking if organic food has genetically modified organisms on it, similar to how I would ask if my pork is free of trichinosis parasites.
Now, given that organic foods are not very strictly policed, and that most GMOs other than Monsanto corn do release pollen, I would guess that there is some cross breeding here or there.
Organic growers are generally smaller farms.
it is got nothing to do with whether GMO's are safe or organic is better or worse.
Are GMO's as good as organic?
The former is created strictly for yield, pest and disease resistance, the latter is gown to be as healthy as possible, (to increase yield, pest and disease resistance) You need rich, good dirt to grow organic, and the plants reflect that in nutritional quality.
TL/DR: There are no good reasons to believe that eating organic has any meaningful benefits for your heath or the environment when compared to conventional agriculture.

Organic producers use pesticides too ( Page on xerces.org and pesticides in Organic Farming ) and these pesticides are likely no less harmful to the environment or human health.
Daniel's answer says that organic produce contains less heavy metals, but without some legitimate sources to back that claim, I would assume that heavy metal concentrations would be similar.
As with any technology, it is a double edge sword providing both benefits and risk to producers and the environment ( there is no known risk from eating GMO food, so human health wise it is neutral).

Except on the basis of cost, for those who cannot afford to pay a premium for certified organic goods.
I would say there is not any information (yet) to suggest that the GMO foods currently on the market are unsafe, and that body of informstion is pretty good, so do not worry about it.
That study was performed by an openly pro-organic advocacy group.
The conclusions are just as suspicious as a study by Monsanto saying GMO food is safe.

Mythbusting 101: Organic Farming > Conventional Agriculture
If I had to restrict my tea diet to only those that are 'certified organic', my soul would be crushed, a far worse consequence in my opinion.
I read certified organic to mean farmers who cut costs elsewhere to pay for the certification fees and/or are being courted by Western vendors.
Farmers and local vendors generally do not bother about organic certification, even if the teas are actually 'organic'.
Since I do not generally buy from Western vendors, I do not care very much for teas that are certified organic.
There is little point in consuming a poor quality tea that has been certified organic.
Farms large and small that exist to distribute food publicly have so many federal regulations on them that the small farmer really struggles to survive these days.
This is the most notable in organic food which must pay extra regulation fees to use the term "organic".

The main reason organic food costs more is because of the fees the federal government charges to use the term organic.
No country produces "mostly" Certified Organic Food.
(e.g.,, to use US standards, food that contains only organic ingredients, or is "made with" at least 70% organic ingredients).
Organic has a lot of different definitions and standards and levels associated with it.
A lot of farms meet all the organic criteria, but do not want to go through the expense of being certified.
That said, the only/best global data we have is based on "certified organic" farms.
** You can see here, the countries with the highest percent of certified organic agricultural land.
Source: <url> " Of course, organic agricultural land does not equate with production.
Here are the countries with the highest number of organic producers: <url> " And, of course, production does not equate with consumption.
For example, in a lot of Latin American countries, over 85% of organic produce is exported.

I wanted to explain the difference between whole foods and organic whole foods.
Let's compare something like regular chicken with organic free range chicken.
The problem with the term organic is that it is ambiguous.
Organic does not necessarily mean the animal is treated humanely or free to roam around.
Ideally, you probably want your chicken to go out and peck and live a healthy life, but that is not a guarantee with organic foods.
While an organic food should theoretically be more nutritious, since they are not pumped with hormones and pesticides, the rules are so vague that it is not a guarantee you are getting food that is of significantly higher quality.
There are certi for your information ng bodies in all countries that certify and ensure the authenticity of organic produce.
In many countries the words 'organic', 'bio', and 'biologically' are legally regulated.
Meaning of 'bio' and 'organic'Since you used the word 'bio' in your question I suspect you are from Europe, because both 'bio' and 'biological' are used in many EU-countries (with a Latin or Germanic language) to refer to what native-English speakers call organic food.
I assume that with 'bio' you mean 'organic' and not bio-based products.
Basically an organic label on a food is a guarantee that the food was produced according to organic farming principles.
Organic food in EuropeFood in EU-member states may only contain the words 'bio', 'biological' or 'organic' if specific regulations are followed in its production and if the producer has been certified by the proper authorities.

Farmers must use organic feed that does not contain substances that artificially promote growth.
Livestock must be born and raised on an organic farm, have enough housing space and the total number of animals should be limited so there is no overgrazing or soil erosion (more info: regulation on livestock) Genetically modified organisms are forbidden (adventitious presence of GMOs with a maximum 0.9% of the product is allowed).

It is a very good question, and one that does not get defined enough in debates about the organic food movement.

Restaurants and grocers will convince Americans to spend more on their produce, and consumers get the satisfaction of both the actual and imagined benefits of eating organically.
There are other perhaps more convoluted stories that may be told depending on the source of the organic food.
Their organic produce prices are incredible.
Their commitment to truly "natural" and organic (non GMO) produce is unmatched by stores like Whole Foods, Trader Joes or Sprouts - all of which try to capitalize on the growing desire in consumers for organic produce but often sell huge amounts of convential food at high prices.
They do not have a fresh meat counter and are generally a bit smaller than other types of grocery stores, but are still well worth shopping at if you value natural/organic food.

So I will assume your question is really more like "Is food with a label of organic certification better for my body than less expensive, 'regular' food."

If you prefer the taste of the organic options, that is immediate feedback and you can personally judge the value.
Personally, I make a point of avoiding "organic" foods as a matter or principle.
Promoting "organic" is to imply that it is somehow better than the other products, and I reject that notion.
To those who claim better taste and so forth, that is absolutely great but that has almost nothing to do with organic, per se .
These same advantages could be achieved with or without an "organic" operation.

If you take an organic carrot that was picked and packed and stored in the same way as a non-organic carrot, which is generally going to be the case for all food found in the grocery store, you will not likely discern a difference.
One conforms to the very loose standards of the National Organic Program and once does not, but otherwise the same practices are employed in their production, including mechanization, massive scale, conveyor belts, warehouses, distributors and middlemen.
The organic carrot is demonstrably a good choice if you care about the environment and probably a better choice if you seek to minimize what artificial chemicals you ingest, but both are industrially grown.
I use carrots as an example because if you want to taste a huge difference, especially between organic and "conventional" (ha!)
Unfortunately, "Organic" has been co-opted as a marketing term by large corporations and their industrialized production, and so that means that the drop in nutrient content applies to organic and "conventional" alike.

The price may be a bit inflated, but if it is truly organic and done right, then you truly can taste the difference.
Unfortunately, most of the so-called organic foods sold at the health food markets are not that great tasting.
But when you get the truly premium stuff, man, it is like a whole different grade of food and you wonder what have you been putting in your mouth all these years.
The environmental effects notwithstanding, as a food, it has to be better for you too because of the lack of chemicals.
it is unlikely that the organic vegetable you bought and the non-organic one are the same variety, picked at the same time, followed the same route to market, and were grown in the same place, so they may taste different.
Generally speaking, outside those factors, the only difference is a tendency for organic farmers to select cultivars of fruits and vegetables that are heartier against pests.
Fresh locally grown produce (regardless of whether it is conventional, organic, or GMO) will almost always be superior in flavor.
Organic tea means that it is grown without the use of any chemically produced pesticides, fertilisers.

In season I can travel to a dozen farmer's markets, roadside stands and people's homes to buy fresh organic fruits, veggies, honey and eggs.
The big farms (read, Monsanto, et al,) caught onto this and instead of fighting against the organic farmers, hopped on the bandwagon and started offering their own lines of organic products with 'farmy' sounding names like Hidden Acres, or Green Valley and such.
It is, as other answers have pointed out, a debatable point as to whether organic food really does taste particularly delicious.
You do not explicitly make a claim as to organic food against non-organic food, but if I sensibly infer such a claim from the "so" qualifier you use, there are plenty of studies that disagree - to a point.
For example, a study in Nutrition and Food Science ( Page on emeraldinsight.com ) found that when blinded, organic juice tasted better, but organic milk did not taste better than non-organic milk.
it is conclusion was that "the global claim that "organic food tastes better" is not valid, and each product type should be treated separately before a claim can be made."
Furthermore, blind taste tests on tomatoes have found them to taste worse if organically grown, and potato and broccoli to be indistinguishable in taste quality ( Organic food less tasty than normal, watchdog says ).
Even Stephanie Zonis, who seems to be generally pro-organic, in a non-blinded taste test, says the results are mixed ( Page on thenibble.com ) and concluding: "I cannot state definitively that organically produced or raised foods taste better (or worse) than their conventionally-produced counterparts.
And a study has been done into that, too: ( You taste what you see: Do organic labels bias taste perceptions?
For two foods (yogurt and potato chips) they clearly preferred the organic food taste.
I feel safe in the knowledge that the locally sourced, organic food I consume is genuinely endorsed by the Soil Association.
While a lot of people are willing to pay the extra cost for organic food, because they have a strong belief that organic foods are safer, tastier, heal their , and environmentally beneficial - there are several ways in which you can avoid paying high prices for organic foods.

Not all this produce is grown organically but it is all much better than store bought.
I also always buy organic beef, milk and eggs, whether at the Farmer's Market or at stores like Whole Foods.
And, even though I will only eat organic beef, I do not think it is as tasty as the commercial beef because grass-fed cattle graze, and because of that are leaner with less marbling in their muscles.
So, in my opinion, eat organic for health reasons, not for the taste.

You may be able to recognize organic produce by the fact that it tends to be smaller in size, and may not be blemish-free - but that definitely, absolutely does not not automatically make it inferior.
And organic food sellers are just too happy NOT correcting this idiotic idea.
And the organic stamp can mean whatever you want it to mean.
It is very easy to show that organic food is smaller, takes up more land to produce, uses a lot more pesticides and has way less vitamins and minerals, all you have to look at is the ingredients, I have seen organic posters even claim that organic foods contain vitamins that it does not contain at all and you can see it when you look at the ingredients on the product.
Organic is worse for the environment, and has no nutritional advantage.
Organic produce is having unlimited benefits.

There is no evidence that organically grown food is more nutritious.
it is perfectly possible to grow organically on an industrial scale where the quality and environmental impact is no better than non-organic.
In other words, not all organic is the same and not all non-organic is the same.
No studies have been done to compare nutrient loss in organic vs. non-organic, so let's assume it is equally true of either.
I am scientifically sure that organic methods lead to higher nutritional food values.
Hence why I buy organic.
There is zero nutritional advantage to organic.
This type of organic usually is more sustainable and often more nutritious and higher quality.

How about omega3:omega6 ratios in organic vs conventional animals?
summary : A rigid dichotomy between organic and conventional agriculture does not appear to be practical at this time.
This helps add some perspective to the assumption that organic farming is perfect for the environment.
Studies in the Maikaal district India have shown that cotton yields due to organic farming have been greater than commercial techniques and have benefited the socio-economic status of farmers.
The need of the hour seems to be an investment in training and education around the benefits of low-input agriculture as well as organic farming.
The 'local and organic' tag needs to be dropped if we need to head in the right direction.
Organic farming is a relatively sophisticated system that combines age old wisdom with modern innovation.
In most cases organic crops are only 1/3 the product output of modern conventional farming.
Organic rules that prohibit certain food preservatives can therefore make organic food less healthy.
In practice organic certification has become something of a racket, so much of a tick-box exercise imposing complex record keeping requirements etc before you are allowed to call your products "organic", and there are different certification bodies which all have slightly different standards.
So there is no evidence that organic food is better or worse for you than a varied diet of conventionally-grown stuff.
Certain non-organic treatments are environmentally-damaging.
However some approved organic farming methods are also environmentally-damaging: nitrate runoff, polluting watercourses, is worse from fields fertilised with manure slurry than from fields fertilised using precise dosages of artificially-produced nitrogen fertiliser.
Practices that require more diverse plantings, with wildflower headlands to attract pollinators and insect predators are more common in organic husbandry.
The only reason why I eat organic food is to limit the chemicals that get inside my body.
When it comes to produce - organic means grown without the use of pesticides ("pesticides" here being a broad term that actually includes fungicides, herbicides, etc.).
There is such an exorbitant amount of such chemicals dumped onto the fields throughout the world that it actually gets me worried that I can get some even while eating organic (but at least I am trying to limit the exposure as much as possible).
When it comes to animal products, organic to me means all that (i.e.
Organic is what normal food should have been all along.
Is organic food really good for you?
This is a broad farming practice issue, not an organic-vs-conventional issue.
Which means, for example, that responsible conventional farming would be better on this point than irresponsible organic farming.
But I agree that there is a correlation between use of organic ingredients and reduced food processing, simply because producers often choose to do both of those things concurrently to maximize appeal to health-conscious consumers.
But there is no inherent relationship between crop growing techniques and food processing techniques.
When you apply organic management you use other crops waste to convert it into organic fertilizer.
In an organic way, you will use a nourished soil for the next crop.
Buying organic is not primarily about your health.
If you are passionate about that, then you need to buy everything organic.
Of course, there may be cases where buying certified organic is, on balance, more environmentally destructive because of food miles and other energy-related issues.
If you are choosing between a non-organic product with low food miles and an organic product with high food miles, organic might be a worse choice.
On the other hand, buying organic helps build the market for organic products, so perhaps more options will exist in the future.
As a last ditch effort, try buying from certified organic outlets.
I always go for BC or New Zealand apples (I live in Vancouver), without bothering about organic or not except as it affects the price.
If there is no choice and I have to buy US apples and other produce, I go for organic ones.
So for safety's sake and also for the bees' sake, US organic apples are safer and heal their than regular US apples, even though they do cost more, while BC "inorganic" apples (if there were such a thing as an inorganic apple I would like to see it.
But not to eat it, I think) are also safe for humans and bees and there is no point in paying extra for organic ones.
In case the question changes, the one I answered was: "How much heal their are organic apples?
First, I already clarified by stating that I use neither synthetic nor organic chemicals on my garden; see above.
Third, assurances as to the "benign nature" of industrial or even natural chemicals to dump on food are not comforting as the same types of assurances were given in the past for the use of DDT, Agent Orange, Thalidomide, prenatal X-Rays, oxygen in the bassinets of premature babies, and mercury flushed into sewage systems.
Among the reasons your assumption about the levels of insecticide and herbicide/fungicide in food are flat out incorrect is that the amounts published by manufacturers are estimated based on (1) assumption of minimum levels used on fields (2) assumption that it will rain one or more times prior to harvest thus "washing off" the crops (3) Assumption that crops go from harvest to mouths, without intermediate steps where more chemicals will be applied.
The net sum is that regular consumers of foods produced under these methods may suffer from "chronic toxicity through ingestion of small quantities of pesticide over a long period" (Halliday) Occurrence, sources and toxicological significance of pesticide residues in food grains One of the leading grain science professors in the world, Dr. Subramanyam Bhadriraju, chaired professor at Kansas State, points out the dangers and failings of your assumptions about the levels and dangers of these chemicals in grains and the application of them in grain elevators that is not accounted for in the USDA/NASS numbers.
Nutritionally there is no difference between organic and conventional produce.
It is not necessary to pay the extra money for organic.
Pesticides are used in both organic and conventional produce and both types are safe and nutritious.
You cannot trust food that will not go bad.
it is safer to eat organic, I would not question it.
Bread, is a mixture of high fructose corn syrup ( special ingredient on almost everything you buy if it is not organic) it is also Genetically Modified Corn which causes tumors in plants, as well as humans.
I eat at least 95% organic and I honestly feel so much heal their , my skin glows, I feel energetic.
I am perfectly healthy and I give a big thanks to those people that work hard to make our food as toxic free as possible.
The only danger I can think of (aside from obesity) is a very serious but avoidable one: contamination from organic fertilizers.
My wife damn near died from eating organic carrots.
E coli and other dangerous bacteria thrive in rich organic matter that has not been composted properly.
Wash all produce carefully, especially if it is organic.
Organic in agriculture and according to the USDA means grown without pesticides.
Buy organic especially apples and carrots, berries.
Watermelon and bananas have such a thick skin, do not bother with organic.
Organic food is heal their , however it is not a well known piece of information simply because the earth cannot support 7billion people organically, therefore the consensus must be non-organic is healthy otherwise you would have mass panic and reprisals.
The problem stems to the fact that issues arising from non-organic farming manifests themselves as lifestyle diseases and various other factors which cumulate over years and decades, not days or weeks.
It therefore integrates it to society and cannot be tested to be inferior, over a decade many factors can come in to play so no one can pinpoint the cause, hence non-organic is deemed as safe.
There will be a few select cases that can prove organic is heal their but as there are so few, you need a 100% consistent lifestyle which few have, they become diluted in the crowd.
The key point, organic in most cases is not truly organic, it is 80-95% organic which the non-organic proponents will take as meaning it is no different from mass grown foods.
In life however, you need both to quantitative and qualitative to balance which is where organic comes in to play, you are playing the long game, prevention is the best cure.
quite shocking, side effect from the chemicals that are in the food sources.
The mouth is a key source and indicator of issues however different foods act differently so a food which is 'naturally' high in a byproduct may not be converted whereas a food which is 'synthetically' high in a byproduct may be converted.
With organic you are, more or less, buying prevention which is qualitative not quantitative, you will normally only know it works years or decades down the line.
it is one of the reasons the wealthy live longer on average, they eat higher quality food and therefore do not put the strain on their bodies which chemical laden food does.
I can only sustain at most 40mg of chemicals in food and water, 1.5 grains of rice, it is rather extreme but then so was the event that caused it Aris Mat's answer to What should everyone know about what is going on with the gas leak in California?.
The key to organic is to 'dilute' the synthetic chemicals in your environment, how much you choose to dilute determines the amount of prevention you are building in to your life, and everyone has a different answer.
However, most non-organic vegetables (except celery) do not contain such dangerous pesticides, so they are not that much more dangerous.
"Organic" foods are neither more healthy nor safer than conventionally produced food items.
"Organic" is a term that denotes a method of production that prefers animal and plant waste instead of conventional fertilizers, and the avoidance of synthetic pesticides.
Numerous studies have attempted to find whether organic vegetables and fruits offer any substantive advantage or benefit, but almost all have failed.
To be fair, I recall that in a European study tomatoes grown organically had increased flavonoids - especially lycopene, and the reason was that there was less stress on the plant.
On the other hand, organic food production is not an advantage when trying to maximize crop yield from limited land.
The advice here is to either cook organic plant foods or wash them extremely well.
A string of recalls for organic products has cast much-needed light on this big food safety myth.
That myth is that organic foods are somehow safer than conventionally produced foods.
Both organic and conventionally produced foods can be contaminated with dangerous pathogens.
In fact, some research has even shown higher rates of microbial contamination on organic foods than conventionally produced foods.
Are Organic Foods Naturally Safer?
that is because berries have been organic since the beginning of time.
Do you understand the difference between organic/non-organically grown food?
Basically organic vegetables and fruits are grown with natural fertilizers.
One of the primary benefits of eating organic is lower levels of pesticides.
Organic produce contain more protective antioxidants, less pesticide residue and low levels of toxic metals.
Organic food is worth the extra cost.
But A recent study examined that organic food is not nutritious.
Some organic products may still be high in sugar, salt,fat or calories.
The best way to be safe from food-borne illness is to choose organic foods.
If demand for organic food increases, its price will fall - somewhat.
But it will always be significantly more expensive than non-organic food.
If they could produce organic at the same price as non-organic, or only a small saving (say 10-20%) they would, and save the bother of spraying etc.
Therefore, if there organic and non-organic alternatives, the organic will always (barring offers, temporary gluts etc) be at least 10% more expensive than non-organic.
If people want organic food, then the producers can charge more , not less .
A viable way to improvethe food in prisons withoutincreasing costs and in a sustainable way is by growingour own food through an organic processsuch as permaculture, hydroponics, and aquaponics.
Growing our food through this process would enable us to have a sustainable, year-round agriculture system that would teach us a valuableskill.
It would reduce our carbonfootprint, insure freshness, and provide us healthy food at a very low cost.
There, The Green Life group aim to start an organicfarm to train its participants in the urban organicfarming process of permaculture and green technology comprised but not limited to food growth, and communityeducation and heritagegarden.
If the correctional system approves The Green Life organic farm initiative, it will be both California's innovative approachto rehabilitating its felons, and a sustainable food process that can be easily replicated in each of its other 32 existingprisons while improving the inmates' nourishment at a very low cost.
Urban organic farminghas been proved, in other states,to be an effective method to loweringfood costs in prisons.
At San QuentinState Prison, the urban organicfarming can also be implemented successfully, with the networking participation of all of you, my nature-lover friends.
If you like to see a positiveimprovement on the food served in prisonswithout being a burden to taxpayers' money, I invite you to support The Green Life's initiative at <url> " and help The Green Life organic farming programto become a reality.
For water, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are prohibited in organic farms so underground water will not be polluted.
For climate, organic farms can store a lot of carbon in the soil which can lower the pace of global warming...
There are so many benefits of organic food.
But it is true that organic food is expensive.
3) The size of the organic food field is smaller than the common one, so things like supply chain are not as good as common food industry, it will cost more.
If demand for organic completely replaces demand for chemical, the price for organic will come down.
Organic foods cost more for one or more of 4 reasons.
The other part is that often it takes more labor to grow organic food.
So part of the cost goes to paying the farmer to grow that food for you organically.
I helped a buddy of mine on his organic farm in Indiana a few summers ago.
There are ways that organic farmers can attempt to work with nature (instead of beating it into submission with chemicals), but it generally involves a lot of manual labor, which means more expensive produce (even when farm hands are paid dollar 9/hour).
Also, the term "organic" must be defined.
The term is rather vague, unless it is "certified organic" as defined by the FDA.
To be certified organic by the FDA involves special regulations and red tape.
I am not trying to be negative of certified organic, that is just the way it is.
There could be two farmers who both grow the same produce, using the same organic methods, but the one who is certified organic.
The certified organic farmer will have to pay various fees for permits and inspections that the organic farmer does not.
The certified organic farmer must charge a higher price for the exact same product that the organic farmer is selling at a lower cost.
But if you by from a "organic" farmer who is not certified by the FDA, he can pour crude oil on it and still call it organic (petroleum could be used as an ALL NATURAL weed killer!!!!).
Side stepping the issue of defining organic for the moment, take it or leave it, my opinion is: organic produce CAN be grown for a little less than what it is sold for today.
If the demand for organic produce increases, there will be more people who begin to supply that demand.
Growing plants in a aquaponic system are almost by definition organic to keep both fish and plants happy.
Organic foods cost more for one or more of 3 reasons.
if you grow it yourself <smiling_face> but meanwhile, when "organic" and "natural" are highly fashionable and in hot demand, they will always be more expensive.
the killer with crap processed food is that it is never very satis for your information ng so you can easily eat a ton.
I would rather buy a smaller amount of natural food that might cost more in weight, but you will need less and will get better nutrition from.
Organic foods are not "sustainable".
Organic foods are not inherently more sustainable than conventional foods.
Buying organic produce at the grocery store is not much different in the big picture than buying their conventional counterparts, other than it is more expensive.
Organic foods can be raised in more careful and responsible ways, that help improve soil fertility, do not rely on much or any ("organic") chemical spraying, and even help contribute to things like biodiversity.
The best way to know about your food is to talk to the person that grows it and hear from them how they do so.
Raising food "sustainably" (while slippery to define, for one thing) would be very difficult to do or even get close to doing-if it is even possible-given the current economic framework in the world.
In a home garden, it is very possible to raise foods "sustainably".
Unfortunately, "sustainable" food sources are mostly theoretical in the modern world.
As of now most people are talking about organic farming and only some are into practices.
The main hurdles/problems in organic farming are: Organic farming is time consumingMore labor or manual work is requiredorganic produce is more expensiveMarketing of organic produce under certification is very expensiveFarmers must some skills/knowledge to choose alternate to chemical farming You can read more about organic farming : HERE.
Organic farms only make up about 1% of the total farmland in the world so supply and demand is one reason why organic produce is more expensive.
Also, organic farming does use fertilizer but they cannot use synthetic fertilizers or fertilizers that contain hormones, antibiotics or GMOs, etc, which is another reason why organic produce is more expensive.
We at LEFO tea (click <url> provide best quality organic tea at 50% of current market price.
Our USP is : LEFO (Local, Exotic, Fair and Organic ).
We swear by our commitment to fair trade and we are certified organic.
We do not want to grow big in size but always be the limited small scale organic exotic growers. As we source directly from our tea gardens, we have the capability to keep the cost at very low level.
There is no inorganic food, does not exist, and frankly cannot exist.
All food is organic, everything.
The only real difference for a product with an organic logo is that it is way to expensive, way more difficult to grow, needs more land and therefore can grow a lot less of it.
Often the organic product has less nutrients, less vitamins and is smaller.
As already the land and water had got polluted by chemical fertilizers this is the only right time time to shift towards chemical free farming/organic farming/permaculture.
And so if one has to start with organic farming then one has to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and other agrochemicals (pesticides, fungicides, nematicides, molluscides, rodenticide and etc.).
so for the upcoming crop supply only organic manures which are cheaply available.
so by doing these and by avoiding such harmful chemicals one can get the fruits of organic farming.
Organic farming is now being accepted by most of the developed countries in the world, in the present scenario.
In organic farming not only non-biodegradable materials are minimised but also we can use biodegradable materials and help the government in managing garbage.
These are the new ways which are still to be introduced related to organic farming which can be adopted without any cost to improve yield- Use of vegetable,fruits waste which are generally thrown into the garbage dump.
Since you are going to start organic farming I will suggest you to apply these things on a small area before using it on a large scale, If you will have good results then go for it.
The idea that "organic" food does not have pesticides is a complete myth.
"Organic" is not better for you and it is not better for the environment.
Reality: The words "organic" and "free range" can be used as long as you fulfill the USDA's pretty lenient criteria.
Conventional, "organic", and "free-range" animals are sometimes grown side by side, differing only slightly in their feed content and cage design.
The thing with organic farming is that one needs to experiment and make up a stratergy according to their farms location ( Water availability, soil, climate etc).
1) Buy a pack of organic seeds/saplings from a trusted vendor.
There are organic ways to control each and every type of pest that you might encounter.
4) Be patient , if the soil has been damaged enough by chemical fertilizers; it will take time ( a year or two) until when you could reap the full benefits of organic farming Most of all you need to connect with nature to get a sense of how to go about.
Often organic agriculture calls for more sustainable practices, however, pollution is not inherently less in organic farming.
Here's an example where pollution could increase in an organic system: Organic corn requires more intensive tillage to control weeds.
Most people think they should do it for health benefit reasons - honestly, what you eat is a much bigger impact then any slight change between organic and conventional would have, where it even has a change.
I am fine with people believing it wrongly, however, since Organic is better for the environment.
The pro-GMO side tends to get wrong how much of a yield increase GMOs do (5% vs best organic practices, 15% normally, 25% vs worst organic practices - to put it into perspective, 50% of food globally spoils, and just eating cattle is 12x more expensive then eating veggies), they tend to get wrong what *IS* GMOed (the amount of people who think it is 90% stuff like golden rice are not rare), etc etc.
The pro-Organic side tends to think that organic uses no pesticide (they do, often shorter lived but more toxic ones), and the fact that it does take more people to farm organic then conventional.
Because I find any conversation about organic or conventional that does not mention LED grow farms is basically partisan hackery that leans towards big-agri or big-organic.
I was big into organic until 2 years ago.
Paying more of organic has not helped the environment, it mainly supports an ideology of being natural.
You can read a meta-study of 100 studies, Does organic farming reduce environmental impacts?
- A meta-analysis of European research , that concludes: However, ammonia emissions, nitrogen leaching and nitrous oxide emissions per product unit were higher from organic systems.
Organic systems had lower energy requirements, but higher land use, eutrophication potential and acidification potential per product unit.
More on the organic farming problems for the environment in here: On farming, animals, and the environment and Delving deeper into the roots of organic - the last one looks at the problem of lower yields in organic farming.
Furthermore, the organic revolution has not been around long enough to compare organic vs. convetional farmers.
As my source points out, organic chemicals can be just as bad, if not worse than synthetic chemicals.
Unfortunately, there is not 100 yrs of research (yet) to show just how bad organic chemicals are.
I suspect cancer rates in organic farmers are not going to be any different than conventional farmers.
Furthermore, application rates of organic chemicals can be many times more than the that of synthetic chemicals.
However, I also disagree that organic farming is the perfect solution to all the worlds problems.
I do not believe the ends justify the means, especially when the prices for organic are drastically higher, mostly due to scare tactic marketing and lies.
For instance, they say organic farming uses crop rotation.
IF organic is better, it is only by a very narrow margin, and that is without taking into account the consumer cost.
Organic produce still uses pesticides.
The only thing that the organic means is that the pesticides must be organic in nature.
Organic is, in many cases, actually worse for the environment.
There is no health evidence linking organic to higher nutrition value.
So, there are no benefits to eating organic.
I am assuming that by "chemical fertilizers" you mean those fertilizers not approved for organic use?
Technically, all fertilizers are chemicals, even horse manure, and many purified fertilizers with simple chemical compositions are approved for organic use.
Organic fertilizers are mineralized by the action of bacteria in the soil, where non-organic fertilizer comes in the form of mineral pellets that just have to disolve.
Although organic fertilizers are much better for the soil, there is no real food safety concern around non-organic fertilizers.
I think it is important to note that agriculture does not have to be viewed as organic versus conventional.
Conventional farming uses many methods that organic farmers use and vice versa.
Thus, they expect organic eggs to be brown, and most organic egg producers will keep breeds of chickens that lay brown eggs to confirm to that.
As you all know foods are sprayed with pesticides and other hazardous chemicals , every day, every hour, every minute in order to keep it fresh.
Which is driving us crazy.. We spend so much on trash food, but never bothered to eat homegrown food !
There are many online organic stores are available across India, if you still do not believe on organic products, certifications are fake.
A 2012 meta-analysis (a study examining lots of other studies to make an overall conclusion) found zero benefits to eating organic, for example.
Little evidence of health benefits from organic foods, Stanford study finds You talk about "exposure," but exposure to what?
it is an organic pesticide!
Take actual Bt bacteria and dump them on a plant, and that is organic.
Your organic food is just as (un)likely to poison or harm you as GMOs; sometimes in a different way, sometimes in the exact same way!
Organic flour - Apply regular fertilizers, for example, excrement or manure, to bolster soil and plants.
Non organic flour - Apply chemical fertilizers to advance plant development.
According to USDA Organic Production ERS data, 2011 had 5.3 million acres of USDA Certified Organic farmland, with 3 million of that cropland and the other 2.3 million rangeland.
0.002% of total land mass in the US is organically farmed.
0.006% of all farmland is organically farmed using USDA Certified Organic certification, yet Organic products accounted for 4% of food sales according to Organic Market Overview .
There are three reasons for this that I can see; A) Certified Organic produce is typically more expensive.
B) Organic produce is more likely to see a human consumer than a pig or cow belly.
C) The USDA slaps an organic label on anything that has 95% organic ingredients, a "made with organic" label on anything that has 70% organic ingredients, and anything that has any one of thousands of non-organically produced ingredients that are "exceptions", but may be expensive.
But rather than get into so many details, I would pose the question back to you: What about all the pesticides used in organic farming?
If you are thinking that organic farming somehow equates to clean and happy and safe and natural food, think again.
For the majority of organic food out there, all it means is that a "natural" chemical pesticide has been substituted for a synthetic version.
Often times those "organic" pesticides are in fact far more harmful to the environment than their synthetic counterparts.
Industrial organic farming (the vast majority out there) is still industrial farming and still has a pretty comparable effect on the environment in terms of energy use, chemical use, and soil treatment, largely because actual growing methods have not really been changed.
Organic, sadly, do not mean much.
In India i recommend <url> " , best online portal for all organic and natural products.
They sell only genuine organic natural products.
O Greenz is a brand providing real organic vegetables and fruits, their taste is exceptional, i questioned about the authenticity of their products.
Im a big fan of <url> " - India's Largest Online Organic Store.
The Rodale Institute is not particularly respected among serious agronomists (I have plenty of friends who work on organic ag, and do not care for them).
For example, their much publicized conventional vs. organic experiments use obsolete and destructive 50 year old techniques such as conventional tillage with moldboard plows.
To be "certified organic" requires more than not treating the cows with rBST.
In the USA, this includes ensuring the cows are fed organically grown feed, which means no pesticides or fertilizers.
Source: USDA imposes new standards for milk to qualify as organic This is not necessarily good for cows: being out in the pasture can be deadly in the wrong climates, such as overly rainy or cold ones.
The requirements for organic food are strict, and not necessarily in the cow's best interest, but there is no question current factory farming is no fun for the cows.
If the non-organic milk is rBST free, that might mean the farm where the cows are raised is caring for their cows' well-being but cannot quite meet all the requirements.
There is a mountain of evidence that organic foods provide zero benefit to the consumer on a medical or nutritional basis.
There is a lot of fearmongering out there to get you to eat organic: Big Organic is just as greedy a corporate entity as any other.
Regular milk is just as healthy, or organic milk just as unhealthy as conventional milk depending on how you feel about dairy.
Plus, food poisoning is always more likely if you eat organic, especially "raw milk," which is almost up there with cigarettes as a poison marketed by its lobby as healthy.
Page on Foodsafetynews Summary: Organic is expensive, probably better for the cows, and potentially better for the environment, but is not better for you.
People care about organic food as they believe (often but not always correctly) that it is heal their for them.
In order to farm organically, the farmer needs to make sure that the soil remains healthy.
Organic farming also releases less toxic chemicals into the environment.
"Organic farming helps provide a safer, more healthy environment by: 1) not polluting our groundwater, rivers, lakes, and oceans with pesticides and chemical fertilizers; 2) reducing soil erosion; 3) improving soil quality; 4) increasing the diversity of wildlife on and near farms; and 5) providing safer working conditions for farm laborers (no exposure to pesticides)."
(Small Planet Foods) However, it can be argued that *just* eating organic food, without also becoming vegetarian, is an exercise in futility.
"Organic crop farming cannot support conventional meat and dairy production, nor can it support the production of organic animal products.
Substituting organic animal products for conventional ones, without a drastic reduction in consumption, clearly is not a reasonable large-scale plan."
Eating organic fruits, vegetables and animal products (if you are not vegan) is also heal their *for* you, as it reduces your exposure to pesticides and other poisons.
I eat organically because the food resourced from trusted sources, and they are less harmful for the environment.
Most importantly, for me, organic farming is giving me guilt-free feeling, when it comes the treatments of the animals and plants involved.
If you can afford it, its a great idea to switch to organic milk!
For one, the cows are fed organic (no pesticide) feed and not given routine anti-biotics.
Organic feed avoids this.
Some organic milk is better than others.
I personally like Strauss milk (whole foods) best, although Trader Joe's is good too.
I agree with you about organic food.
That one is organically farmed Scottish salmon.
The organic meat has come from certified farms where no chemicles were put on the land to fertilise it that the animal had eaten being reared, the organic cow pig lamb or veal was not reared on feed containing chemicles and neither were they given antibiotics.
One thing I have heard is if you are only going to supplement your groceries with one or two organic items it should be dairy due to the rigorous standards that must be applied to the entire supply chain.
For example, according to the Organic Trade Association, for dairy products to be considered organic the animals are treated more humanely than many of their non-organic kind, are fed organic feed and given no preventative antibiotics or hormones.
If you are eating non-organic dairy you are also indirectly ingesting the pesticides and chemicals from the animals feed.
Organic food has the two types Certified,Non-certified I am going to talk here only about Certified Organic food Organic systems rely on more expensive, natural ways of producing foods with the nutrients you are looking for.
Labor and transportation costs Distribution chains are very less In food production Health risks to farmers Environmental enhancement and protection ( Example -higher prices of organic cash crops compensate for low financial returns of rotational periods which are necessary to build soil fertility) Higher standards for animal welfare Credits- Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
Let's see: - way less toxins: no artificial pesticides, fertilizers, heavy metals, herbicides or pollution-related substances - no GMOs - no growth hormones - animals growing in decent conditions: enough space, sunlight - animals eating organic food Much than enough incentives in my opinion .
The claim is that an organic cow will be given "real" drugs when sick enough.
Unfortunately, this renders her irreversibly not-organic, halves her value, and requires her immediate departure.
So instead, they faff around with homeopathy, organic remedies, or clandestinely use antibiotics like a conventional farm.
And organic milk sounds so smooth; it would be a nice label to wear.
Organic egg production is the production of eggs through organic means.
In this process, the poultry are fed organic feed.
According to the United States Department of Agriculture, organic means that the laying hens must have access to the outdoors and cannot be raised in cages.
Demand is quite normal in Chennai, with more people aware of the benefits and availability of organic products.
organic apples are certainly way heal their than of non-organic and standard fresh apples.
organic apples are easily available online or you can just visit FarmerUncle: Order Organic Fruits Online in Gurgaon and Delhi NCR to buy organic apples and other organic fruits online.
Organic spices can be bought online in various stores in India.
Taking budget and availability into consideration, I cannot go 100% organic.
yes, organic fruits are less tastier than non-organic fruits.
but taste has nothing to do with the health, organic fruits are way more heal their that non-organic and i think that is more important.
it is nowadays easy to buy organic fruits online.
Honestly I read about a lot of so called Organic products being coloured and altered just to seem organic, like organic brown rice, is supposedly just coloured.

Unless the restaurateur is truly passionate about the food served at the restaurant, or really wants to optimize the flavors in the food for a higher-end clientele (in which case for example grass fed meats can make a big difference in flavor for those seeking them out), or the concept of the restaurant is such, the ingredients to be sourced will be the cheapest possible in order to maximize profits.

The term "organic" is specifically a marketing term, and does not have anything to do with food quality, safety, or environmental impact - it simply involves certification that the regulatory requirements were fulfilled to obtain a certificate for labelling.
Certification is quite expensive, so much quali for your information ng food does not carry the label.
Markets like Trader Joes and Whole Foods do NOT claim to be 100% organic markets.
What food they sell that is labeled organic (or contains ingredients labeled as organic), is almost certainly compliant.
This is just a loaded marketing term, which in reality stands for more expensive food of lesser quality.

A product is completely organic only if the label says '100% organic'.
I have got food from online organic shops in India and there is nothing clear to say that they are organic or not and what makes them organic.

You can read more about this on the USDA - NOP program website: USDA Accredited Certi for your information ng Agents So yes, foods coming from Mexico can be certified organic.
The USDA certification is a 3rd party independent certification, which means it is not the company producing the food that verifies that the food meets this standard, it is an independent 3rd party certification.
This is the highest standard and verification there is for an organic claim.

But with organic it just keeps building up until the water is so dirty that it makes the produce more dirty than when it came in.
I understand you want organically-grown foodstuffs to be heal their than foodstuffs grown by the usual suspects.

A well balanced diet is what you should go for because when you go on a typical organic juice cleanse, you are not just wasting money on a lot of unnecessary foods but also adding a lot of extra vitamins that your body has to flush out.
Well you can loose weight by eating organic because you are more likely to contract a food borne illnesses from organics than you are from normal food.
USDA is the enforcement of organic labels, indicating certain things may or may not be done or not done.
Organic certified costs in inspections and meeting requirements.
Using organic practices is not organic certified.
it is not so much a matter that organic food (itself), is any better for your body than regular food.
The other main argument lies in the cost differential between organic and regular foodstuffs.
See: Little evidence of health benefits from organic foods, Stanford study finds Of course, even those findings are open to debate: Organic Food vs.
Eating organic on a budget takes planning.
If you just toss organic foods into your shopping cart willy-nilly, you are in for some sticker shock when you get to the checkout.
Instead, start by thinking carefully about exactly which foods you want to buy organic.
Almost everyone would choose organic over non-organic foods,but organic food is a higher price typically because organic food is often produced on smaller scales,which cant really keep up with demand so prices are fairly high,and non-organic food is produced in large numbers so supply often keeps up with demand and prices stay low.
Many people feel strongly that organic food is, or is not, better for health and which is the truth will not be answered here.
If you believe that, go with the organic --- the price difference is not huge compared to your budget unless you are much poorer than I think.
If you want to support organic farming, a system of agriculture that many people strongly feel is better for the environment and for farm workers, go with the organic.
Everyone who wants to shift toward a greener and toxic-free living, dips into the organic diet.
Those of us who earn a modest income can find the prices of such organic food products exorbitant, which causes us to slide back to our old ways.

In India, a food product is deemed organic only when it is certified through the National Program for Organic Production (NPOP).
Buying organic food daily can be heavy on the pockets.
If he is well paid he could afford organic.
If he is smart he will not care if his food is organic or not.
You made me do some homework though because your stance that they are (organic pesticides etc) untested sounded a little strong to be honest.
Anyhow, I think this exerpt ssys it better than I did.. For instance, while organic farmers and food producers grow and produce food without using synthetic pesticides, herbicides, hormones, antibiotics and artificial fertilisers, certain naturally occurring pesticides or herbicides such as pyrethrins, light oils, copper and sulphur and biological substances are permitted for use in organic farming.
So basically then, based on what you are saying, organic fruits and vegetables are no safer than regular
That depends on the motivation of buying and eating purely organic food.
However if it is for the mistaken belief that organic food is heal their and 'better' for you, then no, because that is a fallacious assumption.
Test after test has shown virtually no difference in the nutritional value of organic food, yet test after test has shown that organic food can contain a far higher level of fungi and bacteria, especially on the skin.
There has been no large, replicable studies that have shown any difference in safety between organic and nob-organic fruit.
If you want to consider pesticides a danger despite the majority of evidence pointing against it, then know that organic foods are much more dangerous.
Organic pesticides are much more toxic and dangerous to the environment then synthetic ones, and since they are not as effective they have to use more of them too.
Plus, organic foods are not as closely monitored as GMO foods, which leaves them more room to leave these pesticides on their produce.
Both organic milk and conventional milk are pure, safe and nutritious.
Organic vegetables are fresher and it does not contain any pesticides.
Eating organic food help us to prevent from major and minor diseases.
Organic food is bit expensive in the market.

Bonus tips: Any organic products you see in market will be costlier and will be much safer for health.
Organic fruits and vegetables are very well known for the number of benefits for the overall health of the body.
Here are some of the well known facts that are required by the body that you can get from eating organic fruits and vegetables - Organic food does not contain GMO.
The food grown organically does not contain any number of pesticides or herbicides that are known to be harmful for the body.
And a lot more benefits are there that you can get from adding organic foods to your daily food eating habits to get better health naturally.
In most countries, fresh fruit and vegetables are subject to random checks by the various food standards agencies to ensure that they do not contain excessive amounts of pesticides or any other potentially hazardous chemical residues.
In fact you are statistically more likely to become ill from eating many types of organic produce, for the simple reason that naturally occurring fungal spores can grow on their surface after harvesting, and if the produce is left too long before consumption, these fungi, whilst still not visible to the naked eye, can reach potentially harmful levels.
100% organic: All ingredients must be organic Organic: At least 95% of ingredients are organic; remaining ingredients must be approved substances Made with organic: At least 70% of ingredients are organic As mentioned earlier, you must be sure to read the labels to determine which percentage of organic content is actually contained within the food.
Requirements (Label) Organic - Manufacturers of organic dog food must follow specific guidelines that are governed by specific laws.
May be a processed food including pesticides and fertilizers.
This is not to say that 'natural' dog food is all bad, but only to suggest that its' contents are not all pure.
Some, if not most of natural pet food will contain added ingredients that are not entirely wholesome.
On the other hand, organic food, following specific mandated guidelines will not contain questionable ingredients.
Better overall health and quality of life (longevity)Fewer digestive issuesFewer skin allergies/ailmentsLess food needed to fulfill nutritional requirements *Animal by-products - ( what is left of a slaughtered animal after the parts intended for human consumption have been removed.
I will tell you that there has been an increase in the popularity of organic dog food as pet owners become more educated with the nutritional value this food provides.
If you want to choose foods free from pesticides, then why do you choose organic?
Organic pesticides are just as toxic as regular ones.
Based on the study done by Professor Carlo Leifert in New Castle University in 2015 it seems organic foods are superior to conventional non organic by almost 18-69% in key antioxidants.
Note oxidation and resulting oxidants is one of the key processes leading to antibody development and further development of cancer, thus eating organic will let you stay clear the cancerous route as much as possible.
Minor and anecdotal thing but people reportedly say that organic has a more richer taste too.
I eat organic food because it is not treated with toxic pesticides.
If the organic grower is selecting for vegetables that are resistant to insects they will contain a higher proportions of these toxins which are also harmful to us.
about the number of deaths due to pesticides compared to the number if only organic produce was available.
(lower consumption of fruit and vegetables due to higher cost of organic production, which means they are less affordable, results in higher cancer rates) and the deaths from the increased cancer rates was much higher.
Any fruit or vegetable where you are going to eat the skin you are going to want to buy organic.
But fruits where you do not eat the skin, foods with peels, such as bananas, oranges, kiwi, avocado, onions, are not worth the extra money for organic.
Organic vegetables actually have more pests on them than do those treated with pesticides (Duh!).
There is nothing about organic foods that prevents E. coli or salmonella from being transported on those foods.
It discusses the risk of several organic pesticides to bees.
A list of commonly used organic pesticides can also be found here: Some Pesticides Permitted in Organic Gardening With a quick look, i was unable to find anything relevant on toxicity of organic/synthetic pesticides to humans.

From what i can find, there is no known health benefit from consuming organic produce instead of conventional produce: Organic food consumption and the incidence of cancer in a large prospective study of women in the United Kingdom Organic Food: Buying More Safety or Just Peace of Mind?
Lastly, consider that organic food has its own set of carcinogenic concerns.
There are a variety of organic-approved pesticides, and the only thing they have in common is that they have been around for a long time.
Nicotine sulfate and lime sulfur are just two examples of pesticides approved for use on organic crops that are carcinogenic.
And some studies have found that certain organic crops are more likely to have carcinogenic mold than their conventional counterparts.
there is no reason to think that organic foods are necessarily safer.
It must be reasonable to assume, that should there be a stable measurable difference in the nutritional content of organic food, different reviews would be able to arrive at that conclusion independently of each other.
Instead, we so far have four reviews on similar lines - finding no nutritional or health benefits of organic food.
Pesticide Residues on Organic: What Do We Know?
Organic wine: Organic wine is produced from grapes that are grown organically.
Organic cultivation excludes the use of artificial fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides.
There are more than 2,000 organic wine producers globally.

The question was "Why is it imperative to you to eat organic food?".
A basket of fruit and vegetables, a pesticide and an insecticide and said that you would only make your food from one.
Because the question was about why you should eat organic food, I drew the assumption (perhaps wrongly) that the pictures referred to your thoughts on the question and that you thought conventional food is bad because it contains pesticides and inseciticides and organic food does not.
Genetically modified fruits and vegetables trump being organic.
Synthetic pesticides you ingest with non-organic are xenoestrogens that make you less of a man and give you a higher-pitched voice.
People should buy the best food they can afford and educate themselves about the long term effects of pesticides for themselves and particularly their children to have no control over what they are fed.
Organic is a bit different.
The law that created "organic" in Anerica is known as the National Organics Program (NOP).
This is a document that outlines exactly what "organic" means in America and also made it a law that for you to label something "organic" you must be certified as stated in the document.
If I follow all the standards in NOP regarding agricultural methods but I do not go through the certification process then I can not sell my products as organic.
If I follow even more stringent standards then required by the NOP by I am not certified I still cannot call my products organic.
Now as to what this really means, it is just a way for the large commercial farms to get into the "organic" market.
Small scale organic (and sustainable) farmers that do not have the money to be certified and re-certified every year cannot use the organic label.
There are a lot of chemicals on it I would not consider organic.
"Organic" without USDA certification is illegal and can mean anything, supposedly, though I tell people my produce is organic, I do not sell it in retail markets but directly to the customer.
My process is more stringent than the NOP but I can not legally label my produce organic in a retail market (and it is illegal for them to but from me anyway).
The argument in favor of washing produce is supported when the produce contains surface pesticides (typically because it is not organic, but there are some organic pesticides as well.)
If you are buying fruit or salad that is already in a box and cannot really really be touched by shoppers because it is protected by that box, and you have good reason to believe that the organic pesticides are nonexistent or not particularly harmful, eating that produce without washing it may well be beneficial.
Organic farming is a type of farming completely devoid of chemical fertilisers , pesticides, instead usage of green leaf manures, cow dung, neem, manure made through weeds etc is used for the farming.

To follow organic farming,the field be made chemical free for at least two and half years.
After that the respective organic farming authority approves the land.
In india,there are few certification agencies like in my opinion control private limited and Indian organic cerification agency (INDOCERT) which are accredited to government of India.
National Programme for Organic production (NPOP) Sets the guidelines and rules in india.
Organic farming is a system, which avoids or largely excludes the use of synthetic inputs (such as fertilizers, pesticides, hormones, feed additives etc) and to the maximum extent feasible relies upon crop rotations, crop residues, animal manures, off-farm organic waste, mineral grade rock additives and biological system of nutrient mobilization and plant protection.

'What is Organic?'
And people are not much aware of benefits of organic over the pesticide laden ones.
The answer is simple buddy , the resources used in organic agriculture are the natural waste and organic residues most of the times produced in our own farm ,and since the organic materials are 100% biodegradable the pollution caused by them is negligible.
Look at a list of most pesticide ridden fruits and vegetable, they are worth buying organic.
Do you have any sources for the claim that organic products contain less pesticides and 'toxic metals'?
The point I am trying to make is that where your pesticides come from-organic or synthetic sources-does not change the fact that this method of growing (industrial, including organic industrial) relies heavily on chemical use either way.

Some organic pesticides that I know of; bT - bacillus thuringiensis is a bacterium that actively attacts some insect types, especially moth and caterpillar and some beetle types.
Please note, genetically modified organisms which produce bt toxins (so called Bt corn or Bt cotton) are not organic, but the application of Bt spores at certain times of the year is considered organic.
Organic farming is slowly catching up in India, may be due to the hype created.
All farming practices a few hundreds of years ago were all organic, but inventions during the industrial revolution and population growth all lead to inorganic methods and usage of harsh chemicals in farming.
After realizing the ill effects of such chemicals we are now promoting organic farming methodologies.
Organic just means either no chemicals or no chemicals on the restricted chemicals list are present in the soil or the produce.
Most governments have lists of acceptable or inacceptable chemicals for organic certification.
By organic, I mean as few chemicals as possible.

After you get the all clear, you can label your produce organic for sale in the UK.
Amateur gardeners may use the term more informally bur even for them there is an organisation called Garden Organic which gives advice and gets members to participate in scientific trials of effective organic methods etc.
I am not sure how much of this applies outside the UK but there are pretty strict rules about what is considered to be organic though out the European Union .
Organic is kind of an all-encompassing prospect, with it more recently being used to refer to foods grown without added pesticides.
One of the arguments for organics being heal their is that we are not going to ingest those pesticides used in helping keep foods from getting eaten before reaping.

Understanding the 'USDA Organic' Label Those 275,000 comments and several reports are available publicly.
Go to their website and search National Organic Program.
Does this proposal prohibit use of genetic engineering in organic production?
This proposal prohibits the use of genetic engineering (included in the broad definition of "excluded methods" in this proposal, based on the definition recommended by the National Organic Standards Board) in the production of all foods and ingredients that carry the organic label.275,603 commenters on the first proposal nearly universally opposed the use of this technology in organic production systems.
Based on this overwhelming public opposition, this proposal prohibits its use in the production of all organic foods even though there is no current scientific evidence that use of excluded methods presents unacceptable risks to the environment or human health.
While these methods have been approved for use in general agricultural production and may offer certain benefits for the environment and human health, consumers have made clear their strong opposition to their use in organically grown food.
Since the use of excluded methods in the production of organic foods runs counter to consumer expectations, foods produced with these methods will not be permitted to carry the organic label.
Will genetic engineering be allowed in the production of foods that contain both organic and non organic ingredients?
Organic farming does not have anything to do with, nor does it oppose GMOs.
However, the idea behind organic farming is based on a more natural way to produce our foods and this does not fit the idea of GMOs.
If you look at the issue from all sides you will likely find out that GMOs are a big scam that only supports control over the food procution chain.
In the past, it was this economics that pushed a man to adapt their modes of food production to include genetic modification and chemicals.
Now since business is all about supply and demand, before people knew about the benefits of organic foods, people only cared about shape, size, color, and price.
Now since organic foods are one hundred percent natural, they will lose out to genetically enhanced foods based on the above-mentioned factors every time.
At this point of time, organic foods were definitely not sustainable if they were your only business.
As of recent times, with the prices of organic foods going through the roof, this is a very sustainable business and a profitable one too.
A lot of farmers now adopt new and ingenious methods of producing organic fruits and vegetables.
One such method is called aquaculture, where organic fruits and vegetables are grown in a growing medium and feed off the waste produced from a fishpond.
This is one of the best examples of sustainable organic farming.
Some of the common products are an organic salt, organic sugar, and even organic "daals".

Reference: What is organic farming?
Culinary bulk and retail herbs - certified organic with distribution to major players in the industry.
I believe with the food problems and GMO - the need is for large, quality grown, domestic produce.

Because genetically engineered plants can still be farmed organically.
'Organic' is a method of farming with out synthetic chemicals, hormones and additives.
Although there have been organic foods for some time, in the US, the USDA certified organic program was started in 2002.

Food from Genetically Engineered Plants Genetically Altered Tomato Moves Toward U.S. Approval So, since the standards were already in place and known by the developers of the seeds, then it would appear that the developers chose to develop plants and seeds that did not conform to the standards of the program.
Is there a basic definition of "organic vegetables"?
Because food is so basic, just as basic as water, and shelter, each person is allowed to have their own personal definition of "organic".
Organic farmers did not.
If Monsanto employees were offered an organic fruit on one plate, and a GMO fruit on another plate, which one would they pick for their children?
Just to add on a bit: First we should make a distinction between organically grown tea and organically certified tea.
Not all organically grown teas are organically certified and fewer still may be organically certified in your market.
Generally, it is easier to start a new organic farm then to certify an existing one.
You can probably start a new farm outside the 'core producing area' or 'zhengyan' area of Wuyishan or halfway down the mountain from Wudongshan and get organically certified but of course the drop in quality is expected.
The cost of getting organically certified is almost US dollar 2k.
Additionally, if you want the USDA Organic seal on your product you will need to go through an organic certification agent.
In much of the coffee-growing world, "organic" is more about labeling then the reality of how the coffee is produced.
By definition, their coffee is "organic," but in as much as these farmers cannot afford the certification fees for having their farm deemed "organic," the coffee will not be labeled with the recognized "organic" label.
Having explained that "organic" is really a marketing label rather than a "real" thing in much of the coffee world, the other reality is that there is no difference in taste between a certified organic coffee and one that is not--IF they are the same coffee varietal, grown in the same region, grown at the same altitude, and picked when properly ripened, processed in the same manner after picking, packed and shipped appropriately, roasted by a master roaster, ground fresh before preparation, and served to you hot in a clean cup.
In my opinion, the organic label becomes questionable in these circumstances.
So in order to answer you correctly about organic fresh produces worth buying, we need to consider were you live and what time of the year you are.
So sure I recommend people around me to buy organic only .
Now we demand our markets to have most and same fresh produces all year long and looking spotless, just like it could be compared to industrialized items... Like that, the label 'organic' often becomes unfit.
Agriculture is full of surprises and very often, if produces are treated organically, rarely every year is the same.
Fruits and vegetables with 4 numbers on the sticker means they were conventionally grown, and 5 numbers beginning with a 9 means they were organically grown.
In the UK and EU labelling laws prohibit the use of the term "organic" as an arbitrary marketing term, and it is reserved only for certified produce.
Aha, here we go: Put simply, if you see the "USDA Organic" or "Certified Organic" seal on your food, the item must have an ingredients list and the contents should be 95% or more certified organic, meaning free of synthetic additives like pesticides, chemical fertilizers, and dyes, and must not be processed using industrial solvents.
However, USDA organic does mean something, and in the case of a crop, such as a tomato, it will have to be 100% organic.
Eg: non-organic blueberry concentrate could contain quite a lot of pesticides and still be marked organic, since it is only a few % by weight in the product.
That could be labelled as an organic processed food under USDA or EU regs. but not be nearly as organic as the customer might assume.
While "buy local, know your farmer" and farmer's markets are exploding and are trends, not all farmers at farmer's markets are organic and many use GMO seeds and apply pesticides to their crops.
Today big companies want to get in the organic business because we are demanding it but are also trying to dilute organic standards.
When it comes to preparing for organic farming, in the U.S. at least, it is best to start with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
there is a great deal involved in being certified, and one MUST be certified before one can claim that their product is organic.
For the same species of plant, organic and conventional products have the same nutritional value and flavor.
The only direct benefit to the consumer of organic is avoiding pesticides.
Organic agriculture might be better for the planet, though.
For animal products, the difference in flavor based on what the beast ate would certainly overwhelm any organic/non-organic flavor difference, even if there is one, which I doubt.
So if you want to eat organic, you will have to trust your food vendor, your restaurants, and your restaurant's food vendor.
The problem with store bought veggies is that the regulations for "organic" do not have the same USDA "definition" as our common usages, and that folks (or "regulators") are not always honest when Profit is involved.
Witness the flap a few months ago about the supposedly "organic" milk sold by Safeway and Kroger stores under the "O organics" house label which a organic advocacy group, bought, tested, and found it to be conventional milk which was "relabeled".
Yes, that "organic" milk met USDA standards, but those "standards" are VERY different from Our understanding of the meaning of the word.
Thus, as with the terms "natural", and "cage free"; the term "organic" is being "conveniently" "redefined" by our "regulators" to allow multinational and national corporations to do whatever they damn well please in the name of "protecting" corporate profit at all costs.
Bottom line: If you did not produce it, or personally know the people who did, it may not be what We define as "organic" (no chemicals, no pesticides, no antibiotics, and grown using sustainable methods).
satvikorganic .com/ They have a good variety of organic products.
I am not really sure how you can verify if it is truly organic though; you could always ask the people there.
They seem to be genuinely organic if you want to try... Or you could do as I try to do - grow your own veggies on the terrace (Or at least some herbs and greens).
What "Organic" certification can you get?
You may wish to take a look at the formal organic marking trade: Industry Statistics and Projected Growth
It is a divine place which sells organic products, has a detox cafe and an organic restaurant.
To know if processed and manufactured products are truly organic, you can just check the certification mark but fruits and vegetables are a little harder so buying them from recognized organic outlets would be advisable.
Assuming you mean Organic Food, then this is best thought of as a brand name.
Technically, the label Organic means that the Soil Association has provided the manufacturer with a certificate stating that the food has been produced according to certain, rather arbitrary, criteria.
These criteria include - Crop rotation - No genetic modification - No antibiotics or wormers - No cloned animals - No battery farming These criteria do not include - The size of the farm - The length of the journey from producer to shelf - No pesticides - Free range So, a product labelled organic might have been exposed to pesticides on an enormous farm on the other side of the planet - and a product from your local farm shop might not be eligible for the Organic label on a technicality.
The 'organic' label is abused as much as the concept of 'grass-fed' and 'free-range.'
The marketing term "organic" does not actually mean anything so there is no way to answer your question in that context.
How can I trust the claim that it is organic , and spend extra for it ?
Dont buy from big basket they tell its organic but it is not.
Organic in this context is a marketing term.
It means that food is produced according to the arbitrary standards set by a marketing lobby.

There are definitely some strong environmental and agro-political reasons to choose crops that have been grown in ways that reduce the use of dangerous chemicals, or crops grown by local family farms vs a giant industrial agrocomplex, or heirloom varieties vs monocultures, or to eat lower on the food chain; but those are not issues that are specific to the GMO vs non-GMO debate.
I would be more than happy to eat a genetically engineered heirloom tomato grown organically by a local family farm, if I could find such a thing.
Consider this: health nuts love organic, anti-oxidant rich food, right?
Over 150 such health nuts got Hepatitis A in 2013 from "Townsend Farms Organic Antioxidant Blend."
it is actually not as extreme as me: Two studies covering decades of work both found the risk of food poisoning is the same for organics and conventional food.
But given that organics are more expensive and have no benefit (proven in the 2012 Stanford study), I see no reason to waste money on them.
In the end, you can eat whatever you like (most food poisoning is preventable when food is cooked well), and take anything that makes you feel heal their if you can afford to spend money on it.
Organic is not bad for you, it just is not good for you either.
Generally, however, 'organic' livestock are raised with a pretty sensible approach to antibiotics-that is, if the livestock are sick, the disease may be diagnosed and then treated with antibiotics.
There is no difference in quality or nutritional content between GMO, organic or commercial foods.
The federal rules for "organic" allow all sorts of dubious behavior, while prohibiting the use of "organic" labels on foods that are actually better and more nutritious because they cannot comply with rules designed for vast agricultural business es.
An organic vegetable is largely indistinguishable from a conventionally-grown one.
it is also unlikely to be organic, since that would forbid ever using any chemical fertilizers or pesticides, leaving land fallow for years that local farmers cannot afford.
It should be noticeable in milk, but organic milk is generally subjected to a different pasteurization process.
An organic TV dinner tastes of "processed" rather than "organic".

I only shop at Whole Foods though I know I can get similar items from Trader Joe's and Ralphs.
I do not know what it is, but I feel like the items at Whole Foods are cleaner, better quality, organic (even though I know this is not true), and it is such a pleasant shopping experience all together.
There are organisations that certify the practices on some farms, to show they produce food 'organically' so without the use of artificial fertilisers, pesticides and so on.
However, I have seen organic on bottled water, and other things that are patently not 'organic'.
Most people who eat organic food do not see it as a craze, but as an action that contributes to a better and heal their environment.
Food grown and raised to be certified as organic has been grown without the use of pesticides, herbicides or synthetic fertilisers.
Growing food this way means fewer pesticides, herbicides and chemicals find their way into what we eat and into our soils and rivers, kill our bees, etc.
That is better for us, and better for the environment - organic methods improve the soil, they do not diminish it.
There is some (limited) evidence that organic food is more nutritious but it is certainly the case that eating organic helps the body eliminate potential toxins.
Most people would argue that organic food tastes better too.
So, the main reasons people seek out organic food are health, environmental concerns, a desire to support more sustainable forms of agriculture and taste.
There are some disadvantages to eating organic food.
A big one is the cost, which is high because growing and raising organic food requires expensive accreditation, can be more labour-intensive, have lower crop yields (albeit of superior produce) and usually have poorer access to food distribution networks, increasing freight charges.
Sometimes, and this is my opinion, just because it is organically accredited does not mean it is good for the environment - soy beans, for instance, require a lot of water.
Still, an organically grown soybean is going to be better for the environment than one that is grown using pesticides and herbicides.
You might be eating 'organic chicken' without realising that the only thing organic about how it is raised is the food it is given - it can still be reared indoors, in a shed, and be called 'organic'.
Sometimes too, organic methods are not the most efficient use of land.
I think we should all be thinking about where our food comes from and how it is produced, and the hidden environmental and human costs of agricultural systems.
So the canny organic farmer orders chicks who will grow up to produce nice, brown, recognizable *Not Store Eggs*.
It has nothing to do with organicness.
All those other colors can come from not-organic hens, too.
Supporters say organic produce is safer and more nutritious.
In fact, some claim it even has better taste than non-organic food.
Organic production is also supposed to be kinder toward animals and better for the environment.
No organic certification body I know of allows GM.
- Organic Partnership with Wildlife - Support for the Farming Community - Water and Organic Food Because organic farmers do not use the harmful chemicals within their farming, they are not polluting the ground and the water supply.
would you care to site any research showing a reason not to eat GMOs, or anything showing increased safety from eating organic?
Also, organic producers used pesticides.
Often the higher price for organic food is because yield is reduced, increased labor inputs, organic fertilizer is more expensive than conventional, and people are willing to pay a premium for the organic certification at the store.
There are marketing scams, but organic agriculture is not a scam.
In the food industry it is not unknown for batches to be sold as organic which are *not* organic.
Organic has certain specifications about animal conditions, worker's conditions and a couple other things that ensure a marginally more ethical foodstuff.
The organic rules were designed by large agricultural business es, imposing overhead requirements that small farmers find it hard to meet.
And conversely, they allow processes that the founders of the organic movement find abhorrent: overcrowding, monoculture, poor nutrition safety created by extreme isolation rather than by care for the animals.
that is a virtue of this thing called bio accumulation, and it is one of the contributing reasons organic produce is on the average more nutritious than the competitive goods offered on the shelf next to it.
there is also this whole dialogue about making an attempt at being responsible stewards of the earth, something Organics make a best effort at and evolve as research does.
At this point, we have not quite made a hard choice between organic and conventional methods.
A meta study by UC Berkeley on the yields of organic agriculture vs. conventional agriculture found that the average difference across all the crops they looked at was around 19% (in favour of conventional), but also noted that a lot of the studies analysed were biased in favour of it and that certain practices, specifically multi-cropping and crop rotation, which happen to be common in most of African smallholder agriculture, can reduce the gap to less than 10%.
that is not that much, and given the potential increase we just found, the lower yield of organic farming does not actually make a huge difference.
However without this its difficult to know whether the local market produce is in fact organic or not.
- I have noticed a rise in local market produce that is 'near' organic.
For small volume producers, being certified organic is often expensive.
If something is certified organic we sort of take it at face value.
Organic and non-organic are indistinguishable in terms of risk, safety or health of the milk.
I think buying and eating ONLY organic food is sort of weird and uninformed, though I buy plenty of humane/organic stuff.
Thing is, the system is not perfect: -Ironically, because becoming "certified organic" can be time-consuming and expensive, it can cause problems for small-scale farmers.
-organic food is more expensive and labor intensive; if all available food was "organic", we would have more hungry people, so it does not make sense to support it exclusively -If a friend told me they ate only organic food, I would ask, "What exactly does a business have to do to get certified as 'organic'?"
-"organic" is a word people like, not a 100% gaurantee of smart or ethical business practices.
I like farmer's market food because it tastes better and have a small herb and veggie garden.
Organic food does benefit the environment and we need to keep figuring out more ways to do that.
Will I buy non organic food?
The government's job is to regulate the industry to prevent the loss of control of modified genes, and the funding of research and distribution of information so consumers like the OP stop worrying that somehow GMO foods are magically dangerous, where the cultivated crops they derive from and which, through artificial selection, or FAR more different genetically from wild stocks than the GMOs are from them, somehow are not .
The right question is not, why is not the government subsidizing organic, but why is it subsidizing SUGAR.
Is organic food really better?
It helps you to understand more about organic food: Is Organic Food Really Better and Worth the Higher Price?
I think you are very right about branding and organics labels somehow convince people that the animal they are eating must have lived on some idyllic farm.
Basically, great shopping experience in shortFeel good factor : Wholefoods cleverly greets you with, saplings, flower plants and beautiful fruits.
Good for trying outFood served in Wholefoods is not part of piggyback market strategy but a genuine attempt.
Overdoes for diet and health obsessed individualsFinally, not sure if this is part of each and every Wholefoods store.
I became Wholefoods customer because of their Beer Bar.
Not to forget an option to pick marinated meats from their meat section and get it grilled or cooked in their barIn all, if you visit Wholefoods with an intention of it being a grocery store, everything will feel expensive and over-priced.
They both use pesticides and need to be washed (just different categories and some organic certified pesticides are much nastier to the environment than the conventional varieties), there is no real taste difference, there is no real nutritional difference.
Organic agriculture is not more sustainable than conventional agriculture.
In fact, organic food can contain higher levels of mycotoxins due to less effective fungal control.
Let me give the disclaimer that if money and accessibility were no issue, I would buy absolutely everything organic, fair-trade, and local.
I do agree with grains not being as critical in the spectrum of organic.
I buy non-organic coffee and chocolate (they are seeds, after all) but do choose fair trade if I can.
Any fruits or vegetables that I peel before eating: Bananas, oranges, avocados, I feel OK about choosing non-organic.
I always buy cage-free eggs, but not always organic eggs.
Food that is processed and thus has added crap ingredients anyway (packaged snack foods, breakfast cereals, frozen meals) I do not see the point of organic.
Stuff that IS important to me to buy organic: Meat, dairy, and most fruit and vegetables, especially produce where I eat the exposed part of the plant (leafy greens, berries.)
Even if it is not organic, I prefer the tomatoes my neighbor grew over the organic ones from Brazil at Whole Foods.
However, Whole foods is not the only place that carries organic produce.
There are much cheaper options like Sprouts, if your'e in Southern California, or even national chain stores such as Albertons, which carry a limited number of organic products.
This is partly due to the regulations to do with making "health claims" on food packaging packaging and advertising.
This skews the argument in favour of unhealthy and unethical food producers.
Organic farming has its priorities, namely ecological responsibility and non-toxicity.
Organic farming does not employ poisonous synthetic chemicals in agriculture.
It also prohibits the use of preservatives, so organic food is fresher.
I had a non-organic supermarket bell pepper sit forgotten on a shelf in my flat for two years.
Ever since people have realized a number of chemicals and artificial enhancements present in food products, organic food has become quite a popular choice.
Whether it is overrated or not, is a good question as people have been living on artificially enhanced food for decades without any trouble.
If you are one of those health conscious people who are concerned with everything that goes into your body, organic food is probably for you.
It is for this reason that organic meat is preferred by most people as the animals are allowed to live their natural lives open and free, unlike commercial projects where animals are cooped up in cages their entire lives and fattened on artificial hormones and chemicals.
Organic foods are generally considered heal their and quite popular, and easily available.
Some online stores that sell a variety of organic foods are bigbasket, lalaji24x7, and onekirana.
ABOUT ORGANIC FOOD I would say in short: There is more to the picture of health than what we can see and feel.
Keep in mind: Diet alone, even organic, accounts for a limited portion of what makes people healthy.
Even with the strictest organic rules, it will still very likely conduce to the same dramatic rates of avoidable death: cardiovascular disease, cancer, etc...There are far more important factors than (organic/not organic to) prioritize in the attempt to develop a healthy lifestyle.
In some countries like New Zealand, the word organic is not regulated, you can sell anything calling it organic, even if it is not what people expect it to be.
Many countries have different labels/norms/rules for organic, they differ quite a lot.
Food can be grown organically and still be sprayed with toxic but organic products.
Food can be grown organically and still be covered in bacteria and viruses from the feaces of animals used to fertilize the crops (which is why I believe cover crops / no till are far better).
Organic does not mean ideal, far from it, but it is generally a good step forward to eat less toxic food, I just wish it was more affordable.
If it were, we would probably pay less for supermarket food, less for organic food, and more for truly nutritive food.
Organic does not mean that optimal soil practices were used, like cover crop / no till, which leave the soil and its biological life minimally disturbed and require minimal fertilizer/pesticide use because the the soil is kept covered, and plants are left to decompose slowly on the surface which fertilizes.
Organic does not guarantee anything about the quality of the soil, the nutrients in them and (from a more environmental standpoint) the level and diversity of biological life in them.
All the factors favoring sustainability on the long run, support organic farming as the future of agriculture around the globe.
Let me quote from my previous answer Deekshith Pinto's answer to Can India afford organic farming?
Let us see them one by one:There is no questions about the environmental sustainability of organic farming.
The organic farming techniques have proven to be of far less harm to the environment and human health.
With current state of technology, yes, organic farming is comparatively costlier and gives less output.
Mind you, even these stats vary quite considerably depending on the scale, region, farming practices, etc., and sometimes it has been even demonstrated that organic farming can also be more profitable than inorganic.
However, given the current policy regime of subsidized chemical fertilizers and pesticides and the lack of awareness towards the nuanced techniques of organic farming, it does become less profitable.
At one point the economic viability of inorganic farming also diminishes as the land degrades more and more.
Therefore, it is always beneficial for the farmers to turn to organic farming in the long run, though it might mean less profits in the present circumstance.
The small land holders who live on a season to season basis might find it difficult due to the economy of scales but the medium and large scale farmers must shift to organic farming for their ow interest as well as for the benefit of the society.
The difference is though that "better for the environment" is far less BS than " it is heal their " - because in its actual sense "organic" does mean "better for the environment" while it does not mean "heal their " in its actual sense.
But the pesticides that were used for "non-organic" food are now banned, so that difference is gone.
"Organic" farming and "regular" farming are also difficult to define.
My basic reason is that regular farming can incorporate all the techniques that organic farming employs, plus more .
Organic farming, by the certification definition, is restricted to the use of certain techniques.
A good example of why a discussion needs to consider all these points: organic yields and conventional yields do not differ per se .
But organic yields, when considering labour input, is always substantially less.
In brief there are three big requirements for chickens to be organic.
Organic feed for entire life - exception for first 2 days after hatching 3.
allowed in conventional or organic production.
There are number of website through which you can Shop online organic spices.
I am not sure which is the best organic shop in the country however I have always shopped organic fruits and vegetables from Organicgarden and I have always been satisfied wit h their quick service.
They are into organic industry since last 5 years.
This is a good question and depends on the US definition of Organic wine.
Wine Made With Organic Grapes and 100% Organic wine(USDA Organic).
The first category is (As it is wording states) made from organic certified grapes but not made with organic principles in the cellar.
The total Sulfite level in the finished wine has to be under 10 Parts per Million and no other Non Organic ingredients are allowed.
Of course like all marketeers we think the best Organic wines are the ones we import and distribute through out the US.
But when people who eat a conventional diet are tested, their blood contains detectable levels of pesticides, which disappear when they go on an organic diet.
And Whole Foods places its stores in high density areas filled with rich white people, which helps..
Natural, pesticide-free, not-natural-chemistry free, additive-free are called organic product.
More and more people are turning to natural organic food due to safety and healthy reasons, both for people and environment.
Growing numbers of consumers want foods made with fewer, more simple and natural ingredients and without genetically modified organisms and pesticides.
And If you are looking for organic seeds, Forage Complete is one of the famous brand for providing organic or non gmo alfalfa seed, corn, T in my opinion thy, Oats, Clover and many more.
We are also providing important information about seed grazing alfalfa seed, along with an extensive offering of organic and hybrid seed products.
There is a great myth that organic farms will not produce the same yields that conventional farms do.
As organic farms mature, particularly in Europe where there are many that have been going for decades, they are now starting to produce greater yields than conventional farms.
What about all the pesticides in conventional farming compared to organic?
Foods with tortuous edible surface area (like strawberries and kale) are difficult to wash properly.
I would not personally buy them organic.
I do not buy organic bananas, I just think they taste different.
On a quasi-related sidenote, I have met some Peruvian organic banana farmers.
Now, more than ever, I would buy organic milk.
I grow and eat/juice organic veges.
Eating organic allows my body to detoxify rather than creating further toxification.
If you think eating organic is expensive, just think how much more expensive all those hospital bills will be!
Have a look around at people who eat organic as opposed to those who go for the chemical stuff... the answer to your questions are to be found in their shing good health and energy!
The cost of organic food in supermarkets is outrageous.
My main concern would be questionable authenticity of organic!
I will take food-grade pesticide over e.coli any day of the week.
Organic produce is sprayed with pesticides too, it is just "organic" pesticide meaning it was extracted from a plant (eg low-quality tobacco).
Organic foods are food items produced using processes without synthetics such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
Inorganic foods use synthetics to produce the finished food products.
Organic farming for me is the farming practices acquired with the organic materials (nutrition and base planting materials) using the indigenous varieties of seeds and crops (found and prominent in your neighborhood) , with integrated pest and disease management using either natural predator or biological control without using any of the inorganic (insecticides and pesticides) or nutrition enrichment substrate (fertiliser).
Residue free substances cannot be called organic, which is misunderstood as organic.
Organic food: fully produced based only on organic (life based) nutrients including fertilizers and pesticides (if used).
Organic compounds: any chemical compounds that are found in living things.
Carbon mostly occurs only in living things, so most of the compounds that contain carbon are often called organic compounds.
Natural and organic food is very important part of our life.
Otherwise, a simple answer would be: gmo, organic, or I do not know.
While organic beef and perhaps other meat/animal products (like milk and eggs) have been verified as having better micronutrient profiles and lower incidence of pathogenic microbes (discovered very recently), organic vegetables are not necessarily better than conventional and often have pesticides as well.
The label of "organic" is a type of certification and many organic standards do not exclude pesticides or other chemicals.
Organic foods along with diet/lifestyle fads like gluten-free (for the non-celiac), paleo (pure psuedoscience), and non-GMO (ignorant fear-mongering) are more about business and instilling fear in the scientifically-illiterate consumer.
There is no nutritional advantage to organic anything.
And, besides, it is not possible to call one food "heal their " than another.
Organic, though, is purely a marketing term.
you might tell the people a little more about rotating crops and all of the other measures that are taken as part of the fundamental principals of organic farming to prevent soil erosion and degradation, preserve and conserve the other natural resources like water and the air.
Organic farming is so much more than just sustainable farming, because when you think about it anything can be considered "sustainable" for an undisclosed amount of time... organic farming is more than a struggle to maintain the status quo (sustain) it is by design a regenerative method of farming capable of remediating if not reversing damages that have already been done.
To add on to what Joshua Engel said, farmers charge more for organic produce partly because they paid the USDA a large fee to become certified as organic- this enables them to tack on the label organic, which is a major selling point, is it not?
Our customers always have a lot of trouble with understanding the differences around Certified Organic, Organic and Natural and with good reason.
An excerpt for your purposes from our guide is as follows (from an Australian perspective): Difference Between Organic and Natural - Easy Guide - Nim-Véda Australia Blog It turns out that in Australia at least, Certified Organic refers to products that are Organic and have been declared as such by an appropriate government/independent body.
Companies that are manufacturing Certified Organic Products probably have CEOs that have lost all their hair by now.
Acquiring Organic Certification is not a small feat, it takes loads of time, lots of documentation, going back and forth a gazillion times and heaps of finance.
Organic is probably ( do not shoot me, I did say probably and even italicised it) exactly the same in terms of quality and processing as Certified Organic without the official badge of honour.
What stops some people from purchasing organic however is that there is no official proof.
it is because the manufacturers of Organic Products should have some sort of documentation stating that the products have had no chemical and unnatural processing going on before it got to your fingertips.
Basically organic products are based on trusting the manufacture within reason.
Organic/Natural Based is often referred to as Organic by Default.

Oh come on Craig have you tried regular milk vs organic milk?
No competition, organic milke is like 3x "nicer".
The fundamental principal of organic farming is to produce crops without using chemicals, GMO seeds, or otherwise compromising the yield of the crop so that it is as natural as possible.
Often, this means using manual labor and symbiotic methods for control of insects, weeds, and disease, and organic fertilizer rather than chemical products.
Using natural selection seeds/cultivars, and preventing cross-pollination with non organic crops to insure the harvest produce is not adulterated with non organic produce.
There are natural organic pesticides available to the organic gardener.
Three reasons: Organic not equal Pesticide free.
There are plenty of pesticides that are permitted in organic farming, which you would not want to eat: <url> " In addition, if the fruit grows near or on the ground (for example: strawberries, melons) it is possible to get contaminated with manure - an organic fertilizer.

Increasing the numbers of organic farmers could feed at least as many people, and a hybrid approach is likely even better; I think there are more serious roadblocks to feeding starving people than merely food availbility.
they are prone to exactly the same fallacies that everybody else is (including the "organic equal healthy" fallacy).
yes it is, organic fruits have higher number of nutrients that of non-organic which eventually increase your health in a much faster way than non-organic.

Not at all bothered by 'organic'.
I agree that it is a marketing term but organic produce in the UK states its control body, for example, The Soil Association.
Though I agree that the organic-inorganic debate is a fear-mongering campaign by the same breed of people who wear tinfoil hats and blog about alien abductions, I am a little confused here.
I think so, but variety in foods is more important than just eating organic.
Those restaurants that are seeking to reach the customer base for whom non-GMO, organic, natural foods are important will widely and loudly advertise the fact.
Commercial "organic" is deeply problematic but at least it can be better than the full-on industrial farming on that score.
I think this question meant organic as in from nature, not the "certified non-chemical" whatever.
Muir Glen Organic uses BPA free cans and it is stated on the back of the can in small print "The lining of this can was produced without BPA."
Beware that just because a product is organic does not mean the can is BPA free.
We hear it time and again that organic food is better for health.
While shopping, we even look for the 'organic' label on the products.
But have we ever thought that why organic products are good?
It is proved by various studies that organic products have certain benefits but to what extent that is not always clear.
Some organic products are definitely more important than others and organic tea is no doubt a smarter choice than conventional tea.
Check out the reasons for buying and drinking organic tea are: Chemical free- The first reason to buy organic tea is that it is grown without the using any harmful chemical- fertilizer, pesticides, fungicides, or herbicides.
Choosing organic tea over conventional tea would means no chemicals in your cup and safer environment.
There is not an organic way to grow food and a conventional way to grow food.
There are many ways to grow food, some of which can be considered organic, and all of which can be labeled conventional.
Modern organic agriculture is defined by restrictions on inputs, typically mandates that natural inputs be used.
Beyond that, the organic standards vary from country to country.
(Organic pioneers like Sir Albert Howard tended to be more focused on soil health than the exclusion of synthetics, but times have changed.)
The limitations on fertilizers and pesticides encourage organic farmers to use some really good practices, like planting cover crops.
there is plenty of variety within organic agriculture, too.
Some will use organic pesticides more liberally than others.
This allows for food to be grown on less land, which is a big deal.
Organic will not allow this because it does not like synthetic fertilizers.
Speaking of which, organic agriculture is dependent on synthetic fertilizers.
Yeah, I know that I just said that organic " does not like synthetic fertilizers," but there is a loophole: animals can turn natural fertilizers into synthetic fertilizers.
USDA organic standards allow manure from conventionally-raised animals.
That means you can grow conventional corn with synthetic fertilizer, feed it to a cow, and then use the cow's manure to fertilize organic crops.
They turn grains grown with synthetic fertilizers into all-natural, certifiably organic manure.
Some organic standards, like those in the European Union, are a bit more stringent.
EU organic standards do not allow manure from conventional animals.
However, there are other organic fertilizers, and research has found that organic farms in France have significant dependence on nutrients from conventional agriculture.
I do not mean to come down too hard on organic here, because reusing nutrients that are waste products of conventional agriculture tends to be a good thing.
(However, we also should not pretend that organic fertilizers are completely harmless.
I mention the dependence of modern organic agriculture on conventional agriculture because we need to be careful about prescribing organic as a solution for the whole world.
If organic today is dependent on conventional agriculture, then where would organic be in a world without conventional?
Some organic advocates like to suggest that synthetic fertilizer was developed as a way to put explosive factories to use after World War II.
He concludes that the US could conceivably do without synthetic nitrogen by improving agricultural practices, moderating consumption of animal foods, and reducing food exports.
In the grocery store, we are often faced with the choice of organic versus conventional.
We should not let that choice define the debate about how food should be grown.
Roughly speaking, conventional farmers have incentive to do what is profitable over some time frame, whereas the main governing principle of modern organic is avoiding synthetics.
(I do not worry about pesticide residues on my food, but I do think pesticide exposure is a real issue for farmworkers .)
There are times I will buy non-organic because I want something and it is not available; at those times I default to local/small farm offerings.
My experience is that organic prices are coming down.
Organic romaine lettuce for dollar 3, I just bought 2 organic cantaloupes for dollar 6.
More organic is getting to the grocery stores (or in my case warehouse food delivery) and that is driving the prices down because it is not so rare.
I am just annoyed that the nutrition of our food is being diminished in so many ways (diminished soil nutrients, industrial farming, corn and antibiotics-fed cows, environmental degradation, etc), and there are so few ways around it.
As far as I can tell, organic may be marginally better than conventional, and it does not cost much more at Trader Joe's, so I will continue to choose it when convenient.
But just because organic is not as good as everyone wants it to be, does not necessarily mean conventional is a better option, either, unless price is the main concern.
In the meantime, I will continue to stick to whole foods as much as possible, whether it be organic or not.
We actually wrote a comprehensive guide on this that has been shared a couple of hundred times now <smiling_face> There is a lot of confusion on the difference between organic, certified organic, natural and inorganic foods and though there is no scientific evidence yet that states one is better than the other, organic foods are definitely increasing in popularity worldwide and consistently.
Here's some information from the article for your reference: It turns out that in Australia at least, Certified Organic refers to products that are Organic and have been declared as such by an appropriate government/independent body.
I read an article to further learn about this and this website has a lot of information about the organic industry and organic products.
Sunland, who sold organic valencia peanut butter, went bankrupt sometime after a salmonella issue.
More info: Costco Played Major Role in Bankruptcy of Nation's Largest Organic Peanut Butter Maker , Food Safety News And, to quote one website (1): "Arrowhead Mills used to advertise that their peanut butters were aflatoxin-free and from valencia peanuts, but they have since changed to cheaper peanuts and now no information on aflatoxin or their peanuts being Valencia's appears on their website or label now.

I know that Modmarket cares a lot about the ingredients that go into their foods, if you read the company values it says that they make everything from scratch and do not use any preservatives or artificial sweeteners, plus they have locations all over the country.
They also have gluten free options with a diverse menu and I am pretty sure all of the ingredients they use are organic or natural.
The main reason real organic eggs are brown is that most the heirloom chicken breeds that forage well lay brown eggs.
The organic eggs at the market are probably not real though.
Most likely they are raised just like the other eggs, but with a small porch and a door flap the chickens never use and might not even know exists at all; and organic certified feed.
But these certified organic eggs that are 97% likely to be not meaningfully different than other eggs, need to look like real organic eggs.
There is such a thing as real organic eggs.
It has not much to do if the eggs are certified organic or not, and the eggs can be any color at all on the outside.
Meet Real Free-Range Eggs - Real Food - MOTHER EARTH NEWS But as you will find out, actually most the farmers raising real ones are rebelling against the USDA organic regulatory burden and corruption and those real ones are very likely NOT to be certified organic.
Here is one from New Zealand: This is one example of how you can scale up a proper organic egg operation.
This is a little more labor but avoids the bare patches right beside the coop and includes the hens in the cattle rotation for even a better quality "Beyond Organic":
Organic products must be produced without conventional pesticides, fertilizers made with synthetic ingredients or sewage sludge, bioengineering, or ionizing radiation.
In addition, government-approved certifiers must inspect the farm where the products are grown or raised to make sure the USDA's organic rules are being followed.
Choosing organic during pregnancy depends on only one key factor: what you crave, says registered dietitian Bridget Swinney, author of the books EatingExpectantly, Baby Bites, and Healthy Food for Healthy Kids.
She recommends that you keep a journal of what you eat over a period of about two weeks, and then buy organic versions of the foods that top your list.
If you are a beef-eater, Dr. Greene suggests choosing grass-fed, organically raised cattle.
Though the cost of organic meat can be double that of regular, try treating it like a side dish and opt for smaller servings.
Also consider another source of organic protein that may be less expensive than beef: soy.
But remember that despite its close association to healthy living, soy does not always equate organic.
Eighty percent of the soybean crops grown today are genetically modified, which means the genetic code of the food has been altered in a lab to make it more weed- or bug-resistant.
Dr. Greene says the problem is that no one really knows yet what impact genetically modified foods will have on our health and our farmlands.
So make sure to check the packaging, and do not mistake an "all-natural" label on soy -- or any other product -- as a synonym for organic.
Finally, think about switching to organic milk.
For that reason, milk is one of Dr. Greene's top organic picks.
And though the FDA maintains that all types of milk are equally safe, choosing organic means saying no to a whole chemical system of agriculture.
Organic should be the foundation of anything that Whole Foods might do.
Because of its systematic rejection of many advanced methods and technologies, organic farming produces far less food per unit of land and water than conventional ones.
The low yields of organic agriculture-typically 20%-50% less than conventional agriculture-impose various stresses on farmland and especially on water consumption.
A British meta-analysis published in 2012 in the Journal of Environmental Management found that "ammonia emissions, nitrogen leaching and nitrous oxide emissions per product unit were higher from organic systems" than conventional farming systems, as were "land use, eutrophication potential and acidification potential per product unit."
it is typically because, since organic charges a premium price, some of the farms are better about other practices including transportation to market.
You probably do not notice when conventional food is the better tasting.
Meats before beets when shifting to organic <url> " People feel like they are directly under attack from big food and their gmos while the plight of 'farm' animals is some cause over there.
Organic food is not necessarily better for the environment.
In this sense organic might be better, though to be clear, the way most organic food is grown is still not necessarily "good" for the environment.
Conventional food is cheaper because it is cheaper to produce something without worrying about the environmental costs-and this savings IS passed on to the consumer.
Organic food is more expensive because producing something while trying to be careful about environmental costs is more expensive, and this added cost is also passed on to the consumer.
Benefits of an Organic Diet: 1.
Organic food from the farm tastes better.
Some vegetables and fruits you think had NO taste you can learn the taste, and this improves the variety of food you can prepare.
Foods you already love, like oranges or apples for example, you can learn the different tastes per variety and per season, which I could never experience from conventional food (not to the same intensity).
Pesticides are not just sprayed on food, but we are watering the food with pesticides created from pesticide and drug manufacturers.
See the movie Food, Inc. for more information (full movie link here): 4.
Those are not the seeds we want to grow our food with!
There are more nutrients in food that has no poison.
You cannot just wash those poisons off if we are watering the food with them!
Food with more taste and more nutrients is more satis for your information ng.
When you KNOW that you are doing all that you can to support your body, our food and the earth and water, including the ocean, what could be better than that?
AND the food tastes better!
You do not have to break the bank to eat organic, you just have to know how to shop.
I am not advocating buying expensive organic food.
Sometimes people that grow food in your own neighborhood can be amazing organic resources, and sharing is caring!
The aim for organic producers is to reduce the intensity of pests, and to boost plant health so that pests are not as damaging.
An organic farm should also be biodiverse, which means many types of crops planted on one farm, and space left for wildflowers, hedges, verges, and cover crops which really promote beneficial insects.
Also, as Aran Johnson says below, there are organic pesticides available.
However, a farmer like myself, and anyone who would go through all the pains of being certified organic - the manual weeding, the row cover, the crop rotations and cover crops, would and should make every effort to avoid using these types of 'band-aid solutions', certified organic or not.
I would not say that what organic farmers do is perfect, but I think we are heading in the right direction.
So by supporting organic agriculture, you are doing the right thing.
As long as Monsanto is around, it is more dangerous to eat non-organic food.
Yes, Organic food does go faster.
I usually do not buy Organic food in large quantities because of this reason... you will find me at the super market at least 3 times a week because of this, but I do not mind since I am not wasting money.
I respectfully disagree Craig, organic eating is not 'all about marketing and charging a premium price', its more about promoting a more natural, chemical free, way of eating, just like our ancestors did.
Yes, organic food generally is more expensive, but choosing one or two organic products over non-organic does not have to break the bank, nor do you have to make your entire diet organic.
Organic food is a minority, the more we buy, the more the prices will eventually come down as it becomes more the norm.
But choosing organic milk over non-organic can be a relatively inexpensive way to reduce agricultural pesticides in your diet.
Each year, the Environmental Working Group publish their 'Dirty Dozen' list of fruits and vegetables to avoid if not eating organic and their 'Clean Fifteen' - it is worth having a look at this list in order to decide which you would rather eat organic versions of, and which are not as important to eat organically.
Apples normally come top of the dirty list, so I would advise only eating organic apples, Organic is a choice, best of luck!
Organic is a flawed designation as many point out, and there are organic factory farms and fraudulently labeled organic.
But on the whole organic food is held to higher standards.
When you buy organic you are paying for more expensive food.
There is nothing about being "organic" that will affect the flavor or nutrition of a crop.
Anything labeled as "local sustainable" and for the most part "organic" is just a marketing term.
While the USDA has standards for Organic they are not what people think they are and "sustainable" is so differently defined at this point in time no will will ever know.
The summary is that "organic" and "synthetic" have nothing to do with safety.
Also remember that synthetically derived versions of organic chemicals, since they are identical, are equally safe.
The organic alternative, Pharm Solutions Weed Pharm, is corrosive, can cause permanent eye damage, causes skin sensitization, and is FATAL if swallowed or absorbed through the skin. but also leaves no residue.
In the US at least, any non-organic products used are thoroughly tested for safety.
In particular I am thinking of greater meat and imported food consumption in rapidly developing countries - whether it is organic or not.
So the question is "is organic farming more or less sustainable than traditional farming and how do organic foods fit into the wider sustainability picture."
From my understanding organic food production is not less resource/ land intensive per unit output.
tomatoes farmed traditionally requiring nitrogen fertilisers (energy intensive to produce) and the same weight of tomatoes farmed organically needing more land/water as the individual tomatoes are smaller and more predation by insects etc.
I do think the conversation about organic food got people thinking more about where their food comes from (especially in the 80's and 90's) which is always a good thing!
Regarding my opinion on GM foods, as long as it has been tested well and is approved in many countries, I do not have any problem.
Coming to the main question of Organic Foods in India, to be frank, I do not trust the organic label in India and I am not ready to pay a higher price for it.
Corruption is so much rampant in India that I believe the organic label can be purchased easily.
Unless I see the crops grown in front of my eyes without the use of chemical fertilizers, I am not going to believe the organic label.
While in abroad, I might buy organic food given the price is not too high than the normal one.
I am not aware of a supermarket chain that specifically stocks Organic produce.
However, the two main supermarket players Coles and Woolworths have dedicated sections that stock organic produce.
Furthermore, there are quite a few small and independent organic stores in major cities.
The difference between organic and GMO is that with organic the pesticide can be washed off.
Organic labeling in the US is regulated by the Department of Agriculture, which offers a ton of materials explaining what the labels mean.
A good start is this blog post: Organic 101: What the USDA Organic Label Means .
The main points explaining what Organic and Made with Organic Products are: Produce can be called organic if it is certified to have grown on soil that had no prohibited substances applied for three years prior to harvest.
In instances when a grower has to use a synthetic substance to achieve a specific purpose, the substance must first be approved according to criteria that examine its effects on human health and the environment (see other considerations in "Organic 101: Allowed and Prohibited Substances").As for organic meat, regulations require that animals are raised in living conditions accommodating their natural behaviors (like the ability to graze on pasture), fed 100% organic feed and forage, and not administered antibiotics or hormones.
When it comes to processed, multi-ingredient foods, the USDA organic standards specify additional considerations.
Regulations prohibit organically processed foods from containing artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors and require that their ingredients are organic, with some minor exceptions.
For example, processed organic foods may contain some approved non-agricultural ingredients, like enzymes in yogurt, pectin in fruit jams, or baking soda in baked goods.
When packaged products indicate they are "made with organic (specific ingredient or food group)," this means they contain at least 70% organically produced ingredients.
The remaining non-organic ingredients are produced without using prohibited practices (genetic engineering, for example) but can include substances that would not otherwise be allowed in 100% organic products.
"Made with organic" products will not bear the USDA organic seal, but, as with all other organic products, must still identify the USDA-accredited certifier.
You can look for the identity of the certifier on a packaged product for verification that the organic product meets USDA's organic standards.
As with all organic foods, none of it is grown or handled using genetically modified organisms, which the organic standards expressly prohibit (see "Organic 101: What Organic Farming (and Processing) does not Allow").
From Wikipedia: In the United States, neither the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) nor the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have rules for "natural."
The FDA explicitly discourages the food industry from using the term.
Buy from XIAN YUHUI BIOTECHNOLOGY CO.,LTD , it has organic wheatgrass powder at very reasonable price!
In most cases, there is no evidence that eating organic will make you heal their at all.
The point of an organic or all natural diet is knowing what you are putting in your body.
The best rule is never buy anything that has ingredients you cannot pronounce easily, or are not readily identifiable as food.
Organic and all natural always meet that criteria.
A side benefit of all of this is the food tastes better, and is easier to digest.
I eat organic food because the philosophy of organics is important to me.
That encompasses far more than just eating food, and as does relate to food it is far more than a simple use of pesticides or not-which itself is a laughable simplification of the concept of organic.
Organic food as I mean it might be better referred to as biologically grown.
This is distinct from "industrial"-style organic (not remarkably different than industrial conventional), and is more akin to how the concept was originally intended (before being co-opted by big agricultural business money).
The point I am driving at is that organics is about health, definitely.
I am much more interested in eating plants that are naturally strong and vigorous and thus do not need to be sprayed against pests or diseases at all, whether conventional or organically approved sprays.
If this were a local farmer's market in Europe or the US it is in my opinion better than organic.
Slow and Local and Sustainable are more authentic in practice than Organic.
Organic Food Market is still at a nascent stage in India and might not be mature enough to get the kind of data slices you are looking for.
Some related points that might help you are - Majority (62%) of high-income Delhi NCR households will go for organic food over normal food.
(Source: 62% of Delhi-NCR households prefer organic food) I Say Organic, which is a startup catering to online demand of organic food in NCR is said to be doing a revenue of INR 100K per month (Source: 'I Say Organic' - Seven flourishing food-related start-ups , The Economic Times) You might also have to consider the fact that Online Grocery Sales has not really picked up in NCR (unlike Bangalore, Mumbai et al.).
Hence offline and online organic sales of organic food can portray drastically different viewpoints.
This hard to answer because while chemical fertilizer comes with a known list of ingredients, while organic fertilizer can vary greatly.
There have been studies comparing nutrients in organically grown vs conventionally grown food.
They found organic food may have fewer pesticides but the nutrient values were similar.
So the word organic may also mean the grower is using different variations of pesticides!.
The real cost increase for organic is not regulation but crop loss.
As a organic grower you look at 10% greater losses from pests and disease since you have a smaller selection of pesticides, fungicides, and no chemical weeding.
We organic growers understand this to be the case and come to accept this loss rate for the lack of using non organic products.
i always feel happy to see people opting organic lifestyle.
The following are general requirements for raising organic chickens by most conventions: You have to feed organic chickens organic feed.
Organic livestock must also be tracked from birth to slaughter in order to be certified (to ensure they have been raised using organic methods).
They should usually be born to organically-raised parents (if not they are required to be shifted to organic food before a certain age (48 hours for chicks)).
We started a small organic shop which start selling through online.
We are starting our journey with ten of organic products from honey to coconut oil.
Whole Foods is the store where organic food is most easily available other than private owned local supermarkets.
When you say organic, are you referring to certified organic or organic?
Have you read the British soil associations report 'Organic Farming Food Quality and Human Health'?
Organic food is very hard to come by because true organic food means no artificial toxic pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, definitely no GMOs especially bizarre ones with resistance to herbicides and insects and inability to reproduce and survive in the wild, and no artificial fertilizers but only natural compost material gotten from decayed organic matter.
For millions of years humans have eaten organic food and it is time tested and nutrient dense.
Yes, true organic food may have imperfections in appearance with damage from natural worms, insects, and fungus but that is a sign that the food is healthy and nutritious even for insects and microbes.
Ideal organic farms should have more than one crop grown and many natural flowers, weeds, bushes, and trees surrounding the property.
If you are having health problems then chances are great that you do not have enough organic food in your diet and are eating too much overly processed, nutrient poor, and overly sweetened food and drink.
The phrase you are what you eat is very true and appropriate and most childhood allergies, diabetes, and health problems originate because of a bad diet for the pregnant mother, not being breast fed, and not being fed organic food as young children.
All mostly due to the fact that humans are no longer eating healthy not overly processed organic food and taking too many metabolically altering chemicals, drugs, and medications like antibiotics prescribed by the medical profession and others available over the counter without a prescription.
Toxic chemicals, monoculture agriculture, artificial insemination, and factory farming, is the primary cause of the deteriorating healthiness of the food and drink.
Over processing the food and drink is no great help either.
Support organic food with your dollars and get the government to pass legislation which will not tax the organic food industry and let it thrive and begin to prosper again for a healthy future for all!!!!!
Thanks to the social awareness forums and movements, people of today truly want to switch to organic products.

Regarding "organic" food, Will Geer (the grandfather on The Waltons ) was very interested in botany and organic food, and in fact sometimes gave seminars on the subject.
One of the students asked him to tell the difference between organic and natural foods.
"Well," he said, as he tore a part a piece of lettuce and threw it into a bowl, "this is natural food."
"And this," Will said with a sigh, "is organic food."
Organic food is grown according to the rules made up by organic farmers and marketers.
It just costs more, and is more resource intensive than conventional food.
For best results use mulches which are made of organic material, because as it decomposes it adds to the nutrient value of the soil.
Then, does organic milk provide significant long tern advantages?
As far as my knowledge goes, it is better to go organic when it comes to fruits which gave a thin skin or those that can be consumed with the peal, for eg.
Fruits like banana, orange, grapefruit are ok if not organic.
But if you can afford, it is always best to eat organic produce.
Hmmm, like you, I question everything, and I question the perceived 'safety' of these 'safe levels' of pesticide residues and who sets these safe limits (I have not once said that organic food has a nutritional advantage).
and I also question surveys with set answers such as ''I believe it to be heal their ' as this is subjective and could mean the nutritional argument or the desire for food in a more natural state or pesticide free.
Like I say, its a choice and we must make informed choices, I just do not think we have enough answers from the safe pesticide levels camp (not to mention the very real threat of antibiotic resistance, made worse by routine use in non-organic farming) in order to say that organic farming offers no benefit.
Organic's customers are less price-sensitive.
Also, economies of scale apply less to organic food.
"While I cannot speak for everyone, I primarily buy organic because *I* believe it is...".
Contrary to what you claim, a recent Stanford study (barely 3 months old) published in the Annals of Internal Medicine concluded the following, "The published literature lacks strong evidence that organic foods are significantly more nutritious than conventional foods."
50% higher content in anything considered 'organic'), I am sure many of us would love to know about it.
(1) Are Organic Foods Safer or Heal their Than Conventional Alternatives?
There are many different 'recipes' for organic pesticides and insect repellents.
Many use ingredients that may be natural or organic but still are not good to spray on your food e.g.
The Country Farm Lifestyles website has a comprehensive list <url> " however the following recipe seems the safest: 4 chillies, 4 large onions, 2 bulbs garlic, 2 L soapy water (you can use an organic castile soap e.g.
Because some people, like me, want near perfect food, and are not worried about pesticide residues that are in the part-per-trillion range.
And my desire to pay more for near perfect food, and the fact that there are a lot of people like me, is a larger factor in the market place than the ability of you and people like you to buy enough organic food.
Whole Foods and similar stores are only a small factor in the market.
The question is based on a very common misconception surrounding organic practices.

Of course organic milk is better for people - because of pesticide concentrating if nothing else.
Yes to one of the expensive choices (GMO or organic) rather than the ordinary non-descript stuff.
Truly Organic food would be that which is not genetically modified, free of chemical pesticides and fertilizers and grown in an environmentally sustaining manner.
Thus, most of the times, consumers are easily swindled by so called Organic products that are sold at an exorbitant premium.
The fact of the matter is that truly organic food does exist and costs a fraction of what it is sold at, agrarian communities in Asia and Africa have long eaten organic food literally of the land without any recourse to chemicals and such.
The word organic is defined by the country and as I live in the US I am most familiar with the National Organic Program as created by the USDA (Organic Agriculture).
However, once a company gets their product on the list, any organic farm can use it without worrying about losing their certification.
Organic farming, NOP organic farming, can be just as bad as conventional (but it is good for the economy, lot's a fees and taxes).

Rotenone, the one pesticide most commonly referred to as evidence of the harmfulness of organic practices, has been phased out in the US.
Craig Good is absolutely correct: organic food is not pesticide free.
Labor costs significantly more than pesticide, on a per unit of yield basis, so the overall cost of organic produce increases.
If you are a fruitarian or a raw vegan, buying organic food is super expensive but definitely worth it.
If you are vegan and eat cooked foods, buying organic is optional as foods cooked at temps higher than 118 degrees lose most of their nutritional value.
